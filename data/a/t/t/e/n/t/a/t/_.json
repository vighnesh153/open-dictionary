                    "The first attempt was the enactment of the Belgian so-called attentat clause by Belgium in 1856, following the case of Jacquin 2 in 1854. A French manufaturer named Jules Jacquin, domiciled in Belgium, and a foreman of his factory named CÃ©lestin Jacquin, who was also a Frenchman, tried to cause an explosion on the railway line between Lille and Calais with the intention of murdering the Emperor Napolen III. France requested the extradition of the two criminals, but the Belgian Court of Appeal had to refuse the surrender on account of the Belgian extradition law interdicting the surrender of political prisoners."
