        "From Late Latin abracadabra, a word used in magical writings, of unknown origin. Relationships have been suggested with Abraxas (a Gnostic deity), and with various Aramaic or Hebrew terms עַבְרָא כְּדַבְרָא‎ (avra kedavra, literally “what was said has come to pass”), עַבְדָא כְּדַבְרָא‎ (avda kedavara, literally “what was said has been done”); אַרְבַּע-אֶחַד-אַרְבַּע‎ (arba-eḥad-arba, literally “four-one-four”), but there is little supporting evidence."
