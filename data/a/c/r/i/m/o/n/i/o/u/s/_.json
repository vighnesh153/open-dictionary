        "acrimony +‎ -ous; compare French acrimonieux (“acrimonious”), from Latin ācrimōniōsus (“acrimonious”), from ācrimōnia (“pungency, sharpness; acrimony, austerity”) + -ōsus (“suffix meaning 'full of; prone to', forming adjectives from nouns”) (ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *-went- or *-wont- + *-to-). Ācrimōnia is derived from Latin ācer (“sharp; bitter, sour”) (from Proto-Indo-European *h₂ḱrós (“sharp”), from *h₂eḱ- (“sharp”) + *-rós (“suffix forming adjectives from Caland system roots”)) + Latin -mōnia (the feminine form of -mōnium (“suffix forming collective nouns and nouns designating legal status or obligation”), ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *-mō (“suffix forming agent nouns from verbs”))."
