        "From Latin azȳmita, from Ancient Greek ἀζῡμίτης (azūmítēs), from ἄζῡμος (ázūmos) + -ῑ́της (-ī́tēs, suffix forming masculine nouns meaning being connected to or a member of something, or coming from a particular place). ἄζῡμος is derived from ᾰ̓- (a-, the alpha privativum, a prefix forming words having a sense opposite to the word or stem to which it is attached) + ζύμη (zúmē, “leaven, yeast”) + -ος (-os, suffix forming nouns of result or abstract nouns of action). The English word is analysable as a- +‎ zymo- +‎ -ite or azyme +‎ -ite."
