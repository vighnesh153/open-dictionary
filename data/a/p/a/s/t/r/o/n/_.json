        "From English apo- (prefix meaning ‘away from, separate’) + Ancient Greek ᾰ̓́στρον (ástron, “fixed star”), modelled after aphelion. Ἄ̆στρον (Ástron) is derived from ᾰ̓στήρ (astḗr, “celestial body (including a star, planet, meteor, etc.)”) (ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *h₂eHs- (“to burn; to glow”)) + -ον (-on, suffix forming nominative, accusative and vocative singular nouns)."
