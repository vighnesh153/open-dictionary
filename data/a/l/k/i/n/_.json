        "From Middle English alkin, alkinnes (“of all kinds”) [and other forms], from Old English ealle cynn (“of all kinds”) [and other forms], from eall (“all”) (ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *h₂el- (“all; beyond; other”)) + cynn (“kind; family”) (ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *ǵenh₁- (“to beget, give birth; to produce”)). The English word is analysable as all + kin (“(obsolete) class (of animals, persons, or things) having common attributes, kind”). Compare Swedish allsköns, Danish alskens."
