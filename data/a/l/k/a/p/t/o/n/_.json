        "From German Alkapton, coined by Boedeker (1861) as \"an admittedly somewhat barbaric combination\" of Alkali (“alkali”) + Ancient Greek κάπτον (kápton), neuter present participle of Ancient Greek κάπτω (káptō, “to gulp down”), after the tendency of alkapton to strongly react with oxygen in alkaline solution."
