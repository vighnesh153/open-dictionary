        "From or cognate to French araguate (whence the rare older English spelling araguate), likely from Cariban; compare Galibi Carib arawata and the other cognates listed at alouatte. The Century Dictionary suggests a possible relation to guariba and/or araba (an obsolete word for a howler monkey of the genus Mycetes). On the other hand, Merriam-Webster attributes it to Cariban."
