        "Borrowed from French aileron, diminutive of aile (“wing”), also refers to the extremities of a bird's wings used to control their flight. It first appeared in print in the 7th edition of Cassell's French-English Dictionary of 1877, with its lead meaning of \"small wing\". In the context of powered airplanes it appears in print about 1908, in the French aviation journal L'Aérophile."
