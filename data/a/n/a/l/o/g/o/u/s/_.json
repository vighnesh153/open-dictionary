        "From Latin analogus, from Ancient Greek ᾰ̓νᾰ́λογος (análogos);   Its English equivalent is analogy +‎ -ous. The application to similar features of organisms is nearly as old as the general sense.  Recognizably modern uses of the second sense, distinguishing analagous from homologous, appear in the mid-19th century."
