        "From French anhélation, or directly from its etymon Latin anhēlātiō (“shortness of breath, gasping, panting, puffing”) (compare Late Latin anhēlātiō (“desire; eager pursuit”)), from anhēlātus (“exhaled”) + -iō (suffix forming abstract nouns from verbs). Anhēlātus is the perfect passive participle of anhēlō (“to breathe out, exhale; to draw breath with difficulty, gasp, pant, puff”)."
