        "From the genus translingual Ankylosaurus, from Ancient Greek ἀγκύλος (ankúlos, “crooked”) + σαῦρος (saûros, “lizard”); by surface analysis, ankylo- +‎ -saurus. The word was coined in 1908 by Brown, who did not give any explanation. It may have been intended to refer to ankylosis, a medical condition in which bones fuse and can cause a deformity. Ankylosaurs have some rear ribs fused to their vertebrae."
