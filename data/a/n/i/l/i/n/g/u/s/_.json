        "Allegedly coined by sexologist Richard von Krafft-Ebing who had already used cunnilingus in such a sense of denoting the practice instead of its actor and spread by the tenth edition of Psychopathia sexualis of 1898 (English edition page 185, German edition page 124, referencing a description of his in Centralblatt für die Krankheiten der Harn- und Sexual-Organe Vol. VI of 1895 pages 355–357). However that usage of this word is just one incidental one and such an etymology may be transferred from the observation of other sexological term having spread by Krafft-Ebing’s book. Likely independently coined at various occasions by analogy to cunnilingus as more frequently known, that is a translingual blend of anus +‎ cunnilingus."
