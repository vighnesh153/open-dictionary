                    "The similarity of these persistent invaginations to the agonal is quite marked; like the agonal, they are multiple, rather short, they are in the ileum, and they are ascending, which is not at all an uncommon feature of the invaginations of death. Agonal invaginations in the adult are, however, uncommon and seldom found; but, in spite of this fact, the suggestion is near at hand that perhaps the multiple, healed invaginations here described are, as it were, persistent agonal formations, the death-struggle implied terminating in favor of the patient."
