        "Inherited from Middle English *ambre, from Old English amore. Alternatively, it may be a clipping of yellowhammer or earlier yelambre. Favored over *hammer due to the influence of its German cognate and synonym Ammer (“bunting”) and its predecessors, Middle High German amer and Old High German amaro."
