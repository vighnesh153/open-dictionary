        "From international scientific vocabulary, probably from French amygdalite (“tonsillitis”); the English word does not correspond to its surface analysis, amygdal- +‎ -itis, despite that cognation is involved in all these words (that is, they all trace back to the Latin word amygdala (“almond”)). In English the combining form of amygdalo- corresponds to the amygdala (a brain component), whereas in French the word for a palatine tonsil likewise comes from the Latin word amygdala; the shared semantic connection is that both of the body parts were named for their almond-shaped form."
