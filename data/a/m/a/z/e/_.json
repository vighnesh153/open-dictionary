        "The verb is derived from Middle English *amasen, amase (“to bewilder, perplex”) (attested chiefly in the past participle form, and thus often difficult to distinguish from amased (adjective)), from Old English āmasian (“to confuse, astonish”), from ā- (perfective prefix) + *masian (“to confound, confuse, perplex; to amaze”) (possibly ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *(s)meh₂- (“to beckon, signal”)). The English word is analysable as a- (intensifying prefix) +‎ maze (“(archaic) to astonish, amaze, bewilder; to daze, stupefy”).",
        "The noun is derived from Late Middle English amase, from the verb: see above."
