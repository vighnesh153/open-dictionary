                    "Throughout this book, I have assumed that adpositions (prepositions and postpositions) are not lexical categories, but rather functional categories. […] While this view of adpositions is far from unprecedented, it runs contrary to the more standard generative treatment, championed by Jackendoff (1977: 31-33), in which adpositions constitute a fourth lexical category, filling out the logical space of possibilities defined by the two binary-valued features \n  \n    \n      \n        +\n        \n        \n          /\n        \n        \n        \n        −\n        \n        \n        \n          \n            N\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle +\\!/\\!\\!-\\!\\!{\\mathsf {N}}}\n  \n and \n  \n    \n      \n        +\n        \n        \n          /\n        \n        \n        \n        −\n        \n        \n        \n          \n            V\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle +\\!/\\!\\!-\\!\\!{\\mathsf {V}}}\n  \n."
