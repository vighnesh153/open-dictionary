        "From Middle English amiral, from Old French amirail, amiral (modern French amiral), from a shortening of Arabic أَمِير اَلبَحْر‎ (ʔamīr al-baḥr, “commander of the fleet”, literally “sea commander”). Akin to amir, Amir, and emir. The -d- is probably from the influence of the otherwise unconnected admirable (Latin admīrābilis).",
        "First recorded in English in September 1300, in a description of Gerard Allard of Winchelsea as “Admiral of the Fleet of the Cinque Ports”."
