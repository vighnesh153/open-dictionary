      "description": [
        "Borrowed from Latin afflātus (“a breath, an act of breathing out or breathing upon; breeze, gust of air, vapour, wind; inspiration”), from afflāre (from afflō (“to blow, to breathe”), from ad- (“prefix meaning ‘to, towards’”) + flō (“to blow, to breathe”)) + -tus (“suffix producing an action noun from a verb”). The related Latin word adflātū was first used in the “inspiration” sense by the Roman orator and philosopher Cicero (106–43 B.C.E.) in De Natura Deorum (The Nature of the Gods, 44 B.C.E.), book II, section 167."
