        "From Medhurst and Hepburn’s romanizations, under the influence of earlier Portuguese romanizations, of Japanese 圓 (“round; a round object”) as ye or yen, now 円 (en), from Chinese 銀圓／银圆 (yínyuán, “round silver object(s), especially a piece of eight”): 銀／银 (yín, “silver”) + 圓／圆 (yuán, “circular, round; yuan, yen, dollar”). Cognate with Chinese 元 (yuán, “monetary unit, especially RMB”) and Korean 원 (won, “North or South Korean won”). Doublet of won and yuan."
