        "From Middle English yclept, ycleped, iclept [and other forms] (i-, y- (prefix forming past participles) + clepen (“to say, speak, utter; to call, shout; to name; to address; to appeal to, beg, pray; to ask, request; to appear; to send for, summon; to convene; to call forth, induce; to lay claim”) + -ed, -t (suffix forming past participles of weak verbs)), from Old English ġeclypod, ġeclipod (ġe- (suffix forming past participles or participle adjectives) + clypian, clipian (“to call out, cry; to appeal”) (West Saxon) [and other forms] + -d (suffix forming past participles)). Clipian is derived from Proto-Germanic *klipjaną, *klapjaną (“to be noisy; to chatter”), probably related to *klappōną (“to clap, pound, or strike (especially two things against each other); to make loud noises, especially breathing or pulsating; to chatter”), and ultimately onomatopoeic. Doublet of clap."
