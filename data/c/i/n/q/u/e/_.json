      "description": [
        "From Middle English cink, from Middle French cinq, from Vulgar Latin cīnque, from Latin quīnque. The archaic spelling cinq is taken from modern French cinq, whereas the standard spelling is perhaps influenced by Italian cinque or a misspelling of the French. The variant pronunciation /sæŋk/ is based on Modern French. Doublet of five, punch, pimp, and Pompeii."
