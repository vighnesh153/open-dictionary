                    "421. Men have entertained a conceit that showeth prettily ; namely, that if you graft a late-coming fruit upon a stock of a fruit-tree that cometh early, the graft will bear early ; as a peach upon a cherry ; and contrariwise, if an early-coming fruit upon a stock of a fruit-tree that cometh late, the graft will bear fruit late ; as a cherry upon a peach. But these are but imaginations, and untrue. The cause is, for that the cion overruleth the stock quite : and the stock is but passive only, and giveth aliment, but no motion to the graft."
