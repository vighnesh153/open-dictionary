        "From Ancient Greek κυβερνήτης (kubernḗtēs, “steersman”), from κυβερνάω (kubernáō, “I steer, drive, guide, act as a pilot”). The term is attested since at least 1948 in the book Cybernetics by Norbert Wiener, influenced by the cognate term governor, an early control device proposed by James Clerk Maxwell in 1868. Note also the 1830s French cybernétique (“the art of governing”)."
