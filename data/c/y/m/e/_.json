        "Borrowed from French cime, cyme (“top, summit”), from the Vulgar Latin *cima, from the Latin cȳma (“young sprout of a cabbage”, “spring shoots of cabbage”), from the Ancient Greek κῦμα (kûma, “anything swollen, such as a wave or billow”; “fetus”, “embryo”, “sprout of a plant”), from κύω (kúō, “I conceive”, “I become pregnant”; in the aorist “I impregnate”). For considerably more information, see cyma, which is an etymological doublet."
