        "From earlier sesspool. Origin uncertain.",
        "From cessare (“to remove, to cause to withdraw”). Alternatively, an alteration of English dialectal suspool, from suss, soss (“puddle; mire”) +‎ pool. Another possible derivation is from a folk etymology (influence from pool) from earlier cesperalle, alteration of Middle English suspiral, from Middle French souspirail (“air hole”), from soupirer, souspirer (“to sigh, breathe”), from Latin suspirare."
