        "Uncertain. Occurs in print at least as early as 1831, when Samuel Lover used the expression as one already long-established. He unambiguously stated the derivation of cess in the malediction bad cess to be an abbreviation of success.. OED speculated that it either was from success or from assessment meaning a military or governmental exaction."
