        "chemical +‎ -ization. The spiritual sense was used by Mary Baker Eddy (then known as Mary Baker Glover) as early as 1875, in the first edition of Science and Health: “This chemicalization, or change, often follows our explanations of science, the effect of which is that the patient recovers; disease comes to the surface during the chemicalization, like a fermenting fluid, and throws itself off, sometimes in violent perspiration, eruptions, increased secretions, and discharges.\" p.176.  More recent use, with definition: 1906 (current) edition of Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures by Mary Baker Eddy: \"By chemicalization I mean the process which mortal mind and body undergo in the change of belief from a material to a spiritual basis.\" p 168.",
        "In the spirituality sense, recently further popularised by Catherine Ponder."
