        "From international scientific vocabulary, from New Latin, from Ancient Greek χυμός (khumós, “juice, fluid, humor”), with reference to edema; the word's surface analysis, chemo- +‎ -osis, is of a false friend nature in the respect that the word is not specific to exogenous-chemical–induced cases of conjuctival irritation as the surface analysis might suggest, although the words chemistry and chemical are cognate via the ultimate derivation from Ancient Greek χυμός (khumós)."
