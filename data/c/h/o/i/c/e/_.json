        "From Middle English chois, from Old French chois (“choice”), from choisir (“to choose, perceive”), possibly via assumed Vulgar Latin *causīre (“to choose”), from Gothic 𐌺𐌰𐌿𐍃𐌾𐌰𐌽 (kausjan, “to make a choice, taste, test, choose”), from Proto-Germanic *kauzijaną, from *keusaną (“to choose”), from Proto-Indo-European *ǵews- (“to choose”). Akin to Old High German kiosan (“to choose”), Old English ċēosan (“to choose”), Old Norse kjósa (“to choose”). More at choose.",
        "The adjectival meaning of \"especially good, preferred, select\" was likely influenced by Middle English chyse, chys, chis (“choice, excellent”), from Old English ċīs, *ċīes (“choice; dainty; nice”), related to Old English ċēosan (“to choose”)."
