      "description": [
        "Inherited from Middle English chaudoun (“entrail sauce”), from Middle French chaudun (“entrails”), from Old French chaudun, from Medieval Latin caldūmen, from caldus (“warm”) +‎ -men (nominal suffix). Compare German Kaldaunen (“guts, bowels”), Greek γαρδούμπα (gardoúmpa, “kokoretsi”), Lithuanian koldūnai (“stuffed dumpling”), and Sicilian quarumi (“veal tripe stew”). Doublet of chaudin.",
        "The modern English form has had /ɹ/ inserted after cauldron; the current predominance of the spelling chawdron is probably due to the influence of Shakespeare."
