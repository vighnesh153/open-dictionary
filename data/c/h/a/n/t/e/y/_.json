                    "Then we had a mouth-organ solo or two, which naturally led on to songs. My turn came. I struck up the first verse of a sailor chantey as possessing at least the interest of novelty.Oh once we were a-sailing, a-sailing were we;Blow high, blow low, what care we;And we were a-sailing to see what we could see,Down on the coast of the High Barbaree."
