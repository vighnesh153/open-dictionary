        "Borrowed from French chauvinisme (“idealistic devotion to Napoleon”), named for Nicolas Chauvin, a legendary and excessively patriotic soldier of the French First Republic. The figure of Chauvin became especially famous as a character in the play La Cocarde Tricolore by the Cogniard brothers. The surname is from Latin Calvīnus, a Roman cognomen (whence also the surname Calvin and thereby English Calvinism), from the adjective calvus (“bald”) (ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *kl̥H- (“bald”))."
