        "From Middle English camelion, from Old French cameleon, from Latin chamaeleon, from Ancient Greek œáŒ±ŒºŒ±ŒπŒªŒ≠œâŒΩ (khamail√©≈çn), from œáŒ±ŒºŒ±ŒØ (khama√≠, ‚Äúon the earth, on the ground‚Äù) + ŒªŒ≠œâŒΩ (l√©≈çn, ‚Äúlion‚Äù); ultimately a calque from Akkadian íå®íà§íä≠íÜ† (nƒì≈°u ≈°a qaqqari, ‚Äúchameleon, reptile‚Äù, literally ‚Äúlion of the ground\", \"predator that crawls upon the ground‚Äù). The spelling was re-latinized in the early 18th century. The physics sense was coined by Justin Khoury and Amanda Weltman in 2003 in a paper in Physical Review Letters."
