        "Uncertain. Perhaps from Yiddish חבֿר‎ (khaver, “friend, comrade”), from Hebrew חבר‎ (khavér, “friend”), possibly via Dutch gabber, perhaps from the British dialectal term cob (“take a liking to”).., or a conflation of both. The suggestion that it is a self-referential collective term for convicts and immigrants who departed for Australian shores from the Irish port of Cobh seems chronologically unlikely."
