        "From coel- (a variant of coelo- (prefix meaning ‘hollow’)) + anaglyphic (“relating to an anaglyph”), modelled after French coilanaglyphique. Coelo- is derived from Ancient Greek κοῖλος (koîlos, “hollow; concave; a cavity, hollow”) (ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *ḱewh₁- (“to swell; to be strong”)), while anaglyphic is derived from anaglyph (“decorative ornament worked in low relief or bas relief”) (from Ancient Greek ἀναγλυφή (anagluphḗ, “a work in low relief”), from ανα- (ana-, prefix meaning ‘above; upward’) + γλῠ́φειν (glúphein) (the active infinitive of γλῠ́φω (glúphō, “to carve, engrave”), from Proto-Indo-European *glewbʰ- (“to split”))) + -ic (suffix meaning ‘of or pertaining to’ forming adjectives from nouns)."
