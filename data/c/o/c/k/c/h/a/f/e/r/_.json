      "description": [
        "From cock (“male bird”) +‎ chafer (“beetle”). The Oxford English Dictionary speculates that the name may relate to a resemblance of antennae to coxcomb, or to the beetle’s size. Compare French hanneton (“cockchafer”), ultimately from Frankish *hano (“rooster”). Attested from the late seventeenth century."
