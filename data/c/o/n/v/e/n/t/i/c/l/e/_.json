      "description": [
        "From Late Middle English conventicle, conventicule (“a gathering, meeting (especially a secret or unlawful one); (derogatory) a church”), from Latin conventiculum (“assembly; meeting (or the place involved); association”), from conventus (“assembled, convened”) + -culum (“suffix forming diminutives of nouns”). Conventus is the perfect passive participle of conveniō (“to assemble, convene, meet together”), from con- (“suffix meaning ‘together, with’”) (ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *ḱóm (“along, at, next to, with”)) + veniō (“to approach, come”) (ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *gʷem- (“to step”) + *-yéti (“suffix forming intransitive, imperfective verbs”))."
