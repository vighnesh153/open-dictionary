      "description": [
        "The term originated in early-19th-century England, and is believed to be a corruption of continuation, continue or contingent.  In the past on the London Stock Exchange, contango was a fee paid by a buyer to a seller when the buyer wished to defer settlement of the trade they had agreed. The charge was based on the interest forgone by the seller not being paid."
