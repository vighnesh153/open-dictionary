      "description": [
        "From Middle English cony, back formation from conies (plural) (also as Middle English conyng, conig, konyn, etc.), from Anglo-Norman conis, the plural of conil, from Vulgar Latin *cuniclus (“rabbit”), from Latin cuniculus (“rabbit”), from Ancient Greek κύνικλος (kúniklos). The original pronunciation was /ˈkʌni/ (for the spelling, compare honey and money), but the similarity to cunt (and particularly homophony with cunny) led through taboo avoidance both to the word's displacement in the main by rabbit and bunny and to the spelling pronunciation /ˈkəʊni/ becoming standard. Compare Galician coello, Portuguese coelho, Italian coniglio, and Spanish conejo."
