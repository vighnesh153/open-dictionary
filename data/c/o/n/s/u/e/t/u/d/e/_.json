        "From Middle English consuetude, from Middle French consuetude, from Old French consuetude, learnedly borrowed from Latin cōnsuētūdō (“custom”), from cōnsuēscō (“accustom, habituate; accustom oneself”), corresponding to con- (“with”) + suēscō (“become accustomed to”). First element con- derives from cum, from Old Latin com, from Proto-Italic *kom, from Proto-Indo-European *ḱóm (“with, along”). Second element suēscō is from Proto-Indo-European *swe-dʰh₁-sk-, from *swé (“self”) + *dʰeh₁- (“to put, place, set”); related to Latin suus (“one's own, his own”). Doublet of custom, costume."
