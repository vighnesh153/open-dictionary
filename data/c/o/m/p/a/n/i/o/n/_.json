        "From Middle English companion, from Old French compaignon (‚Äúcompanion‚Äù) (modern French compagnon), from Late Latin compƒÅni≈çn- (nominative singular compƒÅni≈ç, whence French copain), from com- +‚Äé pƒÅnis (literally, with + bread), a word first attested in the Frankish Lex Salica as a calque of a Germanic word, probably Frankish *galaibo, *gahlaib≈ç (‚Äúmessmate‚Äù, literally ‚Äúwith-bread‚Äù), from Proto-Germanic *gahlaib√¥. Compare also Old High German galeipo (‚Äúmessmate‚Äù) and Gothic êå≤êå∞êå∑êåªêå∞êåπêå±êå∞ (gahlaiba, ‚Äúmessmate‚Äù); and, for the semantics, compare Old Armenian ’®’∂’Ø’•÷Ä (…ônker, ‚Äúfriend‚Äù, literally ‚Äúmessmate‚Äù). More at co-, loaf. Displaced native Old English ƒ°efƒìra (literally ‚Äúfellow traveler‚Äù). Doublet of company"
