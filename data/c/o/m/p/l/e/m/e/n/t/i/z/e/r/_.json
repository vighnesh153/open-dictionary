                    "However, what is of particular interest to us here is the fact that the presence of the Complementiser whether in (37) (b) above excludes the possibility of having an inverted Auxiliary in pre-subject position, as we see from the ungrammaticality of (38) below: (38)      *John wondered whether would he get a degree Why should this be? The answer we propose here is that this is because both Complementisers and inverted Auxiliaries occupy the pre-subject C position: hence, when (as in (38) above) the C position is already filled by the Complementiser whether, inversion of the Auxiliary is not possible, on the assumption that once a given position is filled by one constituent, it cannot be filled by another (i.e. we can only have one constituent occupying any given position)."
