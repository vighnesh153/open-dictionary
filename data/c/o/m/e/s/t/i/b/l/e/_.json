        "Borrowed from Middle French comestible, or its source, Late Latin comestibilis, from Latin comedō (“I eat”), from com- (English com-) + edō (“I eat”) (as in English edible), from Proto-Indo-European (whence also English eat). Cognate with Spanish comestible (“grocery”).",
        "Attested as adjective in late 15th century, from Middle French, but fell from use in the 17th century, thence reintroduced from Modern French in 19th century.",
        "Corresponding terms in various Romance languages, more distant cognates include Portuguese and Spanish comida."
