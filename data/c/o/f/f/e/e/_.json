      "description": [
        "From Dutch koffie (“coffee”), from Italian caffè (“coffee”), from Ottoman Turkish قهوه‎ (kahve, “coffee”), from Arabic قَهْوَة‎ (qahwa, “coffee, a brew”). The Arabic word originally referred to wine, a drink which was traditionally mixed and served hot in a similar manner. In Arabic \"to brew\" utilizes the same triliteral root as wine and intoxicant; see خ م ر‎ (ḵ-m-r) \"to cover over\", presumably with hot water. Other sources instead claim it traces back to the name of the Kaffa region of Ethiopia, which is an Omotic word. Doublet of café and caffè and cognate with the words for \"coffee\" in other major European languages, most of which are derived from the Turkish and Italian words."
