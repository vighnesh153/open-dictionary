                    "If we reinterpret these phenomena in terms of a consistently game-playing model of behavior, the need to distinguish be- tween primary and secondary gains disappears. The correla- tive necessity to estimate the relative significance of physio- logical needs and dammed-up impulses on the one hand, and of social and interpersonal factors on the other, also vanishes. Since needs and impulses cannot be said to exist in human social life without specified rules for dealing with them, in- stinctual needs cannot be considered solely in terms of biologi- cal rules, but must also be viewed in terms of their psycho- social significance—that is, as parts of the game."
