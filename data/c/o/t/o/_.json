        "From Spanish coto (“half-span, quarter-cubit”), supposedly a variant of codo (“Spanish cubit”), from Vulgar Latin forms of Latin cubitum (“elbow, Roman cubit”), but more probably a development of or influenced by Latin quārtus (“a fourth”) from its use as a fourth of the cubit or Latin quattuor (“four”) from its approximation of the span across four fingers."
