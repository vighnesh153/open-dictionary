Women's coathardies trailed on the floor, but those for men could be cut very short.",

                    "The old tunic, overtunic and cyclas were too sad and simple for the new fashions, so now strange and brilliant cotehardies, pourpoints, courtepies, paltocks, hanselines and many other wondrous garments, particoloured or diapered, with with looped, embroidered or escalloped edges, flamed and glittered round the King."
