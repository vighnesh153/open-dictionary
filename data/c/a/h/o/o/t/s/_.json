        "From earlier cahoot.  This word was used in popular English literature in the early nineteenth century. It comes perhaps from French cahute (“hut”), from Middle French quahute, from Old French *cahute, chahute, possibly as a blend of cabane (“cabin”) and/or caverne (“cavern”) + Old French hute (“hut”); or alternatively from Old French ca- (pejorative prefix) + hute (“hut”). Also possibly considered to be from French cohorte, or a slang form of English cohort in the meaning \"accomplice.\""
