        "Borrowed from Late Latin campana, traditionally taken from Campana (“Campanian”), from the diocese of Nola having been the supposed location of St Paulinus's introduction of bells to Christian ceremony, but sometimes derived from Ancient Greek καπάνη (kapánē, “felt helmet”) owing to a supposed resemblance of shape."
