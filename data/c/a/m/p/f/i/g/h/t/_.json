                    "William discovered an inclination to humanize his people by abolishing trials by ordeal and campfight.  [â€¦]  The trial by campfight was performed by single combat, in lists appointed for that purpose, between the accuser and the accused. He who, in such a case, came off victorious, was deemed innocent; and he who was conquered, if he survived his antagonist's resentment in the field, was sure to suffer as a malefactor some time after."
