        "From Late Middle English canonizen (‚Äúto declare as a saint; to appoint to an ecclesiastical office‚Äù), from Old French canonisier (modern French canoniser (‚Äúto canonize‚Äù)), or from its etymon Medieval Latin, Late Latin can≈çnizƒÅre, the present active infinitive of Latin can≈çniz≈ç (‚Äúto recognize as a saint, canonize; to declare as authoritative or official‚Äù), from Latin can≈çn (‚Äúmeasuring line; (figurative) precept, rule, canon; authorized catalogue‚Äù) + -iz≈ç (suffix forming verbs). Can≈çn is derived from Ancient Greek Œ∫·æ∞ŒΩœéŒΩ (kan·πìn, ‚Äúmeasuring rod; general principle, norm, rule; model, paradigm‚Äù); the further etymology is uncertain, but it may be related to Œ∫·æ∞ÃÅŒΩŒΩ·æ± (k√°nnƒÅ, ‚Äúgiant reed (Arundo donax); reed mat‚Äù), ultimately from Sumerian íÑÄíàæ (gi.na). The English word is analysable as canon (‚Äúgeneral principle, rule; authoritative group of works; catalogue of saints canonized in the Roman Catholic Church‚Äù) +‚Äé -ize."
