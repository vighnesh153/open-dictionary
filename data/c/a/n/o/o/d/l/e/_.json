        "Origin unknown; compare Swedish knulla (“to fuck”), Norwegian Bokmål knulle (“to fuck”), German knuddeln (“to cuddle”). The German word comes from Knoten (“knot”), so it may be that \"close contact\" is the root concept. Folk etymology cites the use of two-person canoes as an activity to escape the presence of a chaperon by couples during Victorian and Edwardian times, and the activities such privacy allowed. Supposedly, a \"canoe\" and \"paddle\" were used to sail away from the chaperone."
