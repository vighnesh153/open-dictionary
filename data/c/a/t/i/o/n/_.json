        "Borrowed from Ancient Greek κᾰτῐόν (katión), neuter present participle of κᾰ́τειμῐ (káteimi, “to go down, come down”), from κᾰτᾰ- (kata-, “downwards, down, cata-”) +‎ εἶμῐ (eîmi, “to go, come”). Coined by English polymath William Whewell in 1834 for Michael Faraday, who introduced it later that year. Equivalent to cat(a)- +‎ ion"
