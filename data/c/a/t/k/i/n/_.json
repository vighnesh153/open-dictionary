        "From Middle Dutch katteken (“catkin”, literally “little cat”), equivalent to cat +‎ -kin. So named due to the resemblance of lengthier kinds to a kitten's tail, or, perhaps more probably, the fine fur found on some catkins (compare the pictures). Cognate with German Kätzchen, modern Dutch katje."
