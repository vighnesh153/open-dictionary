                    "My lord's sayings and doings are most amusing. As I mentioned his cacology, I will give you a sample. His second wife took great pains to improve him, but in vain. When he came here under her tutelage, she watched his words, and always corrected him, even before company. One day, being asked to take some lunch, he declined, saying ‘I have been eating selvedges all day.’ My Lady, correcting, said, ‘Sandwiches, my Lord.’ He replied, ‘Ah, my Lady, I wish you'd be quiet, you're always rebuting me.’"
