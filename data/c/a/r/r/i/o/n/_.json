        "From Middle English caroigne, borrowed from Anglo-Norman caroigne, from Vulgar Latin *carōnia, from Latin caro (“flesh”). Compare French charogne.",
        "The regular modern English form would be *carren, *carron /ˈkæɹ.ən/ (this is found dialectally; see below); the intervening /i/ is probably  a hypercorrection based on the analogy of words like merlin/merlion."
