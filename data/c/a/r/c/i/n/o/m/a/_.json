        "Learned borrowing from Latin carcinōma (“tumour; ulcer; carcinoma”), from Ancient Greek κᾰρκῐ́νωμᾰ (karkínōma, “sore, ulcer; cancer”), from καρκινοῦν (karkinoûn, “to make (something) resemble a crab”), καρκινοῦσθαι (karkinoûsthai, “to become cancerous; to suffer from cancer”, passive) + -μᾰ (-ma, suffix attached to verbs to form neuter nouns denoting the effect or result of an action, a particular instance of an action, or the object of an action). Καρκινοῦν (Karkinoûn) is derived from καρκῐ́νος (karkínos, “crab; the zodiac sign Cancer; sore, ulcer; cancer”) (according to Paul of Aegina (c. 625 – c. 690) in his Medical Compendium in Seven Books, because the veins surrounding a cancerous tumour resemble a crab’s legs), ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *(s)ker- (“to bend; to turn”) (as a crab’s pincers form a circle) + *-iHnos (suffix forming adjectives of materials). The English word is a doublet of cancer, and may be analysed as carcino- +‎ -oma.",
        "The plural form carcinomata is a learned borrowing from Latin carcinōmata, from Ancient Greek κᾰρκῐνώμᾰτᾰ (karkinṓmata)."
