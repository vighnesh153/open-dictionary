        "Borrowed from French caramel, from Spanish caramelo, from Portuguese caramelo, dissimilated from Late Latin calamellus, diminutive of calamus (“reed”) (and therefore a doublet of chalumeau and shawm), from Ancient Greek κᾰ́λᾰμος (kálamos), ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *ḱolh₂mos. Alternatively from Medieval Latin cannamellis, which is a compound of canna + mellis."
