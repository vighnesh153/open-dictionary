        "From Middle English carpe (late 14th century), via Old French carpe from a surmised Vulgar Latin *carpa (which is also the source of Italian carpa). The word is of Germanic origin, cognate with Old High German karpho. An East Germanic origin (unrecorded Gothic *karpa) has been proposed, as the fish was introduced from the Danube."
