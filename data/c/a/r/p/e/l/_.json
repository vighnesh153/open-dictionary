                  "meaning": "(botany) A constituent part of a flower pistil - the individual female reproductive organs in a flower. A carpel is composed of an ovary, a style, and a stigma, although some flowers have carpels without a distinct style. In origin, carpels are leaves (megasporophylls) that have evolved to enclose the ovules.  A pistil may be composed of a single carpel or of several carpels fused together.",
