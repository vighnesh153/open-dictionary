      "description": [
        "From Middle English calwe (“bald”), from Old English calu (“bare, bald, callow”), from Proto-West Germanic *kalu, from Proto-Germanic *kalwaz (“bare, naked, bald”), from Proto-Indo-European *gel(H)wo- (“bare, naked, bald”). Cognate with West Frisian keal (“bald”), Dutch kaal (“bald”), German Low German kahl (“bald”), German kahl (“bald”), Swedish kal and kalka (“bald”), Russian го́лый (gólyj, “bare, naked, nude”).",
        "Compare similar meaning and similar sounding Latin calvus (“bald”), Finnish kalju (“bald”), Persian کل‎ (kal), and Sanskrit कुल्व (kulvá), which despite close resemblance to the Germanic and Slavic terms are probably false cognates with them."
