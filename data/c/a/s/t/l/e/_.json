        "From Middle English castle, castel, from late Old English castel, castell (‚Äúa town, village, castle‚Äù), borrowed from Late Latin castellum (‚Äúsmall camp, fort‚Äù), diminutive of Latin castrum (‚Äúcamp, fort, citadel, stronghold‚Äù), possibly from Proto-Indo-European *kat- (‚Äúhut, shed‚Äù). Doublet of castell, castellum, and ch√¢teau. Parallel borrowings (from Late Latin or Old French) are Scots castel, castell (‚Äúcastle‚Äù), West Frisian kastiel (‚Äúcastle‚Äù), Dutch kasteel (‚Äúcastle‚Äù), German Kastell (‚Äúcastle‚Äù), Danish kastel (‚Äúcitadel‚Äù), Swedish kastell (‚Äúcitadel‚Äù), Icelandic kastali (‚Äúcastle‚Äù), Welsh castell. The Middle English word was reinforced by Anglo-Norman/Old Northern French castel, itself from Late Latin castellum (‚Äúsmall camp, fort‚Äù) (compare modern French ch√¢teau from Old French chastel). If Latin castrum (‚Äúcamp, fort, citadel, stronghold‚Äù) is from Proto-Indo-European *kat- (‚Äúhut, shed‚Äù), Latin casa (‚Äúcottage, hut‚Äù) is related. Possibly related also to Gothic êå∑êå¥êå∏êåæêçâ (hƒì√æj≈ç, ‚Äúchamber‚Äù), Old English hea√æor (‚Äúrestraint, confinement, enclosure, prison‚Äù). See also casino, cassock."
