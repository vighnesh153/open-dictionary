        "From the name of the American shoe company, Crocs, Inc. Apparently, this name came to the founders’ mind when they looked at their clogs from the side, and they resembled them a crocodile snout (additionally, the logo features a crocodile). The company states that it “was given the name Crocs™ after the multi-environment, amphibious nature of Crocodiles.” Likely influenced by the name of the material they were originally made from, Croslite."
