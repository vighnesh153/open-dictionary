        "From crocker (“(obsolete) potter”) +‎ -ery (suffix with the sense ‘a class, group, or collection of’ forming nouns). Crocker is derived from crock (“earthenware or stoneware jar or storage container”) + -er (suffix attached to nouns indicating persons whose occupations are indicated by the nouns); crock is from Middle English crok, crokke (“earthenware jar, pot, or other container; cauldron; belly, stomach”) [and other forms], from Old English crocc, crocca (“crock, pot, vessel”) [and other forms], from Proto-Germanic *krukkō, *krukkô (“vessel”), from Proto-Indo-European *growg- (“vessel”)."
