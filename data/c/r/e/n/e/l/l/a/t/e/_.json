        "From French créneler (“to form the shape of a crenel, crenellate”) + English -ate (suffix forming verbs meaning ‘to act in the specified manner’). Créneler is derived from Old French crenel (“crenel, embrasure”) (modern French créneau) (from Latin *crēnella, diminutive of crēna (“incision; notch”); compare Old French cren (“a notch”)) + -er (suffix forming infinitives of first conjugation verbs). The English word is analysable as crenel +‎ -ate."
