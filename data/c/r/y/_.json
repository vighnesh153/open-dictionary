      "description": [
        "The verb is from Middle English crien (13th century), from Old French crier (“to announce publicly, proclaim, scream, shout”) (whence Medieval Latin crīdō (“to cry out, shout, publish, proclaim”)).\nThe noun is from Middle English crie, from Old French cri, crïee.",
        "The origin of the Old French (and Middle Latin) word is uncertain, if Germanic, it is from Frankish *krītan (“to cry, cry out, publish”), from Proto-Germanic *krītaną (“to cry out, shout”), from Proto-Indo-European *greyd- (“to shout”). Cognate with Saterland Frisian kriete (“to cry”), Dutch krijten (“to cry”) and krijsen (“to shriek”), German Low German krieten (“to cry, call out, shriek”), German kreißen (“to cry loudly, wail, groan”), Gothic 𐌺𐍂𐌴𐌹𐍄𐌰𐌽 (kreitan, “to cry, scream, call out”), further Indo-European cognates: Latin gingrītus (“the cackling of geese”), Middle Irish grith (“a cry”), Welsh gryd (“a scream”), Persian گریه‎ (gerye, “to cry”), Sanskrit क्रन्दन (krandana, “cry, lamentation”).",
        "An alternate etymology connects the Medieval Latin word to  quiritō (“to wail, shriek”). This is itself of uncertain origin, perhaps from  Latin queror (“to complain”) through the form, though the phonetic and semantic developments are difficult to trace; alternatively,  a variant of quirritare (“to squeal like a pig”), from *quis, an onomatopoeic rendition of squeaking. An ancient folk etymology understood it as  \"to call for the help of the Quirites,\" the Roman constabulary."
