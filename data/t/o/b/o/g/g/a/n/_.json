        "The noun is attested since 1829, the verb since 1846. Both derive from French tabaganne, which derives from an Algonquian word, probably Mi'kmaq tepaqan or Abenaki dab√¥gan, influenced by similar words in other Eastern Canadian Algonquian languages. The sense of \"hat\" is recorded since 1929 and is short for toboggan cap (1928), a cap suitable for wearing while tobogganing."
