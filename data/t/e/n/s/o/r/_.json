        "Borrowed from New Latin tensor (“that which stretches”), equivalent to tense +‎ -or. Anatomical sense from 1704.\nIntroduced in the 1840s by William Rowan Hamilton as an algebraic quantity unrelated to the modern notion of tensor.\nThe contemporary mathematical meaning was introduced (as German Tensor) by Woldemar Voigt (1898) and adopted in English from 1915 (in the context of general relativity), obscuring the earlier Hamiltonian sense. The mathematical object is so named because an early application of tensors was the study of materials stretching under tension. (See, for example,  Cauchy stress tensor on  Wikipedia.Wikipedia )"
