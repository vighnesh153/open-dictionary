                    "I have been thoughty of my grandmother all week, every day actually. Thoughty is a word straight from Gramma's dictionary and is defined by an inner cognitive awareness of someone. It is more than thoughtfulness. It is a more intense character trait as it involves the spirit on a much deeper level. When I am thoughty of someone, they are not only on my mind, but in my heart, and connected to and felt by my spirit. This is what it means to be thoughty."
