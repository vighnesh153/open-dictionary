        "From Old English þurfan, from Proto-Germanic *þurbaną. The vocalism in -a- is due to leveling from the present singular forms, while the loss of -f/-v- is probably due to simplification of the consonant cluster in forms like thurfte → thurte, which then analogically spread to forms lacking a cluster."
