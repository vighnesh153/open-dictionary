        "The noun is derived from Late Middle English thropul, þropul (“trachea, windpipe”); further etymology uncertain, but possibly a variant of throte-bolle (“laryngeal prominence, Adam’s apple; larynx; epiglottis; animal’s esophagus or neck; flesh covering throat of a deer”) [and other forms] (whence English throat-boll (obsolete)), from Old English þrotbolla [and other forms], from þrote (“throat”) + bolla (“bowl”) (possibly ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *bʰel- (“to blow; to swell up”)).",
