        "From Middle English toile, from Anglo-Norman toille, tuille, taken to be variants of Old French tieulle (modern French tuile, from Latin tÄ“gula, and thus a doublet of tile and tuile. The French term occurs in only one medieval work and the English term in only two (one a translation of the French work), where the meaning is less than clear; it has been suggested that the interpretation of the term as referring to an element of armor is an error by 1800s antiquarians."
