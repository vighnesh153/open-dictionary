      "description": [
        "From Latin tuba (“tube, trumpet, military trumpet”), first borrowed as a historic term in the 18th century. The name of the modern instrument was borrowed in the 19th century from German Tuba (“tuba”), originally Baß-Tuba (literally “bass tuba”), from the same Latin source. The Latin term is of obscure ultimate origin, but is possibly connected to tībia (“shinbone, reed-pipe”), see there."
