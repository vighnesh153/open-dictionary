      "description": [
        "From Middle English tilte, from Old English tyltan (“to be unsteady”), related to the adjective tealt (“unsteady”), from Proto-Germanic *taltaz, ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *del-, *dul- (“to shake, hesitate”), see also Dutch touteren (“to tremble”), North Frisian talt, tolt (“unstable, shaky”).. Cognate with Icelandic tölt (“an ambling place”).",
        "The nominal sense of \"a joust\" appears around 1510, presumably derived from the barrier which separated the combatants, which suggests connection with tilt \"covering\". The modern transitive meaning is from 1590; the intransitive use appears 1620."
