        "From Middle English til, from Northern Old English til, from or akin to Old Norse til (‚Äúto, till‚Äù); both from Proto-Germanic *til (‚Äúto, toward‚Äù), from Proto-Germanic *tilƒÖ (‚Äúplanned point in time‚Äù). Not a shortening of until; rather, until comes from till with the prefix un- (‚Äúagainst; toward; up to‚Äù) also found in unto. Cognate with Old Frisian til (‚Äúto, till‚Äù), Danish til (‚Äúto‚Äù), Swedish till (‚Äúto, till‚Äù), Icelandic til (‚Äúto, till‚Äù). Also related to Old English til (‚Äúgood‚Äù), German Ziel (‚Äúgoal‚Äù), Gothic êçÑêåπêåª (til, ‚Äúsomething fitting or suitable‚Äù)."
