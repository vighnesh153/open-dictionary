        "From Portuguese tanque (“tank, liquid container”), originally from Indian vernacular for a large artificial water reservoir, cistern, pool, etc., for example, Gujarati ટાંકી (ṭā̃kī) or Marathi टाकी (ṭākī). Compare the Arabic verb اِسْتَنْقَعَ‎ (istanqaʕa, “to become stagnant, to stagnate”).",
        "In the sense of armoured vehicle, first attested in  1915, prototypes were described as tanks for carrying water to disguise their nature as well as due to physical resemblance."
