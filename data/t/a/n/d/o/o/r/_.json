        "From Hindustani तन्दूर (tandūr) / تندور‎ (tandūr), from Persian تنور‎ (tanur), from Middle Persian [script needed] (tnwl /tanūr/, “oven”), ultimately from Akkadian 𒋾𒂟 (tinūru), all meaning (clay) oven. According to the Dehkhoda Dictionary, the Akkadian word consists of the parts ṭīn meaning \"mud\" and nuro/nura meaning \"fire\" and is mentioned as early as in the Akkadian Epic of Gilgamesh, cf. also Avestan tanûra and Pahlavi tanûr. Doublet of athanor."
