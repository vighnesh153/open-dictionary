                    "Most research on Colocasia esculenta has been done on taro (C. esculenta var. esculenta), which is grown in Hawaii, the Pacific islands and the Philippines, where it is an important staple food. Assumptions about the development of eddoe have to be based on extrapolations from taro, which belongs to the same species but is grown for the main corm, or from tania (Xanthosoma sagittifolium) [...]. However, eddoe, taro and tania differ in their morphology and duration of growing period."
