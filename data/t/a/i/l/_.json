        "From Middle English tail, tayl, teil, from Old English t√¶ƒ°l (‚Äútail‚Äù), from Proto-Germanic *taglaz, *taglƒÖ (‚Äúhair, fiber; hair of a tail‚Äù), from Proto-Indo-European *do·∏±- (‚Äúhair of the tail‚Äù), from Proto-Indo-European *de·∏±- (‚Äúto tear, fray, shred‚Äù). Cognate with Scots tail (‚Äútail‚Äù), Dutch teil (‚Äútail, haulm, blade‚Äù), Low German Tagel (‚Äútwisted scourge, whip of thongs and ropes; end of a rope‚Äù), German Zagel (‚Äútail‚Äù), dialectal Danish tavl (‚Äúhair of the tail‚Äù), Swedish tagel (‚Äúhair of the tail, horsehair‚Äù), Norwegian tagl (‚Äútail‚Äù), Icelandic tagl (‚Äútail, horsetail, ponytail‚Äù), Gothic êçÑêå∞êå≤êåª (tagl, ‚Äúhair‚Äù). In some senses, apparently by a generalization of the usual opposition between head and tail."
