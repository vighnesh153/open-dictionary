                    "The passe-gardes we have mentioned are also clearly visible, and notice should be taken of the horizontal plates, called taces, extending from the breastplate to protect the hips. As we have seen in the last reign, two small pointed plates, called tuilles, are affixed by straps in the front to the lowest of the taces, so as to give a further protection to the thigh; and under them is visible a short tunic of mail, which, we thus learn, still continued in military use."
