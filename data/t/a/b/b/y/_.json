        "Mid 17th century French tabis, from Arabic عَتَّابِيّ‎ (ʕattābiyy), ultimately from Arabic الْعَتَّابِيَّة‎ (al-ʕattābiyya), a quarter of Baghdad (named for a Prince عَتَّاب‎ (ʕattāb)) which is associated with the manufacture of a certain type of waved silk. See also taffeta, another type of silk whose name derives from the Persian تافته‎ (tâfta, “woven cloth”) and shares a similar etymological origin."
