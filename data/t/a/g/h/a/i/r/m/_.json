        "Borrowed from Scottish Gaelic taghairm, possibly from gairm (“to call, to cry”), from Old Irish gairm, from Proto-Celtic *garrman, from Proto-Indo-European *ǵh₂r̥-smn̥, from *ǵeh₂r-, *gʰel- (“to call, to cry, to shout”); compare Irish toghairm (“an invocation, a summons”), from gairm, gair (“to call; to invoke”), ultimately from the same Proto-Indo-European roots.",
        "The Encyclopædia Britannica (3rd ed., 1797) suggests a derivation from Scottish Gaelic ta (“a ghost, a spirit”) + gairm (“to call, to cry”), while the editor of an 1871 edition of Sir Walter Scott’s The Lady of the Lake suggested tarbh (“a bull”) or targair (“to foretell”). The reliability of these etymologies is uncertain."
