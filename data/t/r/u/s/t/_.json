      "description": [
        "From Middle English trust (“trust, protection”). Long considered a borrowing from Old Norse traust (“confidence, help, protection”), itself from Proto-Germanic *traustą, but the root vocalism is incompatible, and now it's considered a reflex of an unattested Old English *trust, from a rare zero-grade proto-Germanic variant of the same root also attested in Middle High German getrüste (“host”). Ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *deru- (“be firm, hard, solid”).",
        "Akin to Danish trøst (“comfort, solace”), Saterland Frisian Traast (“comfort, solace”), West Frisian treast (“comfort, solace”), Dutch troost (“comfort, consolation”), German Trost (“comfort, consolation”), Gothic trausti (“alliance, pact”). Doublet of tryst. More at true, tree."
