At least since Kant, transcendental philosophies have been on the scene. However, such simple demonstration of the possibility of transcendental philosophy has not been effective and is not likely to be so — so strong is the presumption that transcendental philosophy just could not be possible, or, if it was possible earlier, it is not possible now."
