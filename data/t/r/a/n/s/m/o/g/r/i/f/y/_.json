        "17th century; origin uncertain, but possibly from transmigure or transmigrate. It is also possible that this word is a formation derived from maugre, hence it originally signified the \"evil eye\", but under the influence of the former etymologies shifted its meaning to its sense of \"transformation\". Another possibility is a humorous blending of transfigure and modify."
