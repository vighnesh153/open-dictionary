      "description": [
        "From Middle English trampen (“to walk heavily”), from Middle Low German trampen (“to stamp”) (trampeln (“to walk with heavy steps”), see trample), or Middle Dutch trampen (“to stamp”), from Proto-West Germanic *trampan (“to step”), from an extension of Proto-Indo-European *dr-, *drem-, *dreh₂-. Doublet of tremp.",
        "The noun sense “vagabond” evolved from the sense “one who tramps”, from 1664. The sense \"ship\" is from about 1880, sense \"promiscuous woman\" is from 1922.",
        "Cognate to Dutch trampen (“to stamp, kick, step”), dialectal German trampen (“to step, walk, tread”), whence commoner German trampeln (“to trample”). Probably related to trap."
