        "From Middle English trenden (“to roll about, turn, revolve”), from Old English trendan (“to roll about, turn, revolve”), from Proto-West Germanic *trandijan (“to turn, roll, revolve”), apparently derived from a strong verb Proto-West Germanic *trindan. Cognate with Dutch trent (“circumference”). Akin to Old English trinde (“ball”), Old English tryndel (“circle, ring”). More at trindle, trundle."
