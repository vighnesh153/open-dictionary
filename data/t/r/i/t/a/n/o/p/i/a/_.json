                    "Tritanopia is an extremely rare hereditary condition corresponding to a loss in function of the short wavelength sensitive cones. To produce transient tritanopia, the eye of the normal observer is first strongly adapted to a yellow light that maximally adapts the pigment of the long and middle wavelength cones, but has relatively less influence on the short wavelength sensitive cones."
