                    "Trigonometry emerged in the Hellenistic world during the 3rd century BCE from applications of geometry to astronomy; the Greeks focused on the calculation of chords, while mathematicians in India created the earliest known tables of values for trigonometric functions such as sine.",
                    "Historically, trigonometry has been applied in areas such as geodesy, surveying, celestial mechanics and navigation."
