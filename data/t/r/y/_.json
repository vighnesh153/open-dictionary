        "From Middle English trien (‚Äúto try a legal case‚Äù), from Anglo-Norman trier (‚Äúto try a case‚Äù), Old French trier (‚Äúto choose, pick out or separate from others, sift, cull‚Äù), of uncertain origin. It is probably related to Italian tritare (‚Äúto grind; to sort; to analyze‚Äù) (see also French trier). Alternatively, believed to be a metathetic variation of Old French tirer (‚Äúto pull out, snatch‚Äù), from Gothic êçÑêåπêçÇêå∞êåΩ (tiran, ‚Äúto tear away, remove‚Äù), from Proto-Germanic *teranƒÖ (‚Äúto tear, tear apart‚Äù), from Proto-Indo-European *der- (‚Äúto tear, tear apart‚Äù), see tear. Related to Occitan triar (‚Äúto pick out, choose from among others‚Äù), although the Occitan verb could also be a borrowing from French. Alternatively or by confluence, the Old French is from Gallo-Roman Vulgar Latin *triare, of unknown origin.",
        "Replaced native Middle English cunnen (‚Äúto try‚Äù) (from Old English cunnian), Middle English fandien (‚Äúto try, prove‚Äù) (from Old English fandian), and Middle English costnien (‚Äúto try, tempt, test‚Äù) (from Old English costnian)."
