        "Perhaps borrowed through obsolete Dutch mompen (“to cheat, swindle, deceive”), according to Kroonen, a derivative of Proto-Germanic *mump- (“to stain”), from Proto-Indo-European *mm̥bʰ-neh₂-, related to Ancient Greek μέμφομαι (mémphomai, “I blame, accuse”).",
        "Also akin to German mimpfeln (“to mumble”), Icelandic mumpa (“to take into the mouth”). See also English mum."
