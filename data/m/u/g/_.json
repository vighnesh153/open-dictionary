        "Early 16th century (originally Scots and northern English, denoting \"earthenware, pot, jug\"), of unknown origin, perhaps from North Germanic (compare Swedish mugg (“mug, jug”), Norwegian mugge (“pitcher, open can for warm drinks”), Danish mugge), or Low German mokke, mukke (“mug”), German Low German Muck (“drinking cup”), Dutch mok (“mug”), also of unknown origin. Perhaps related to Old English muga (“stack”) and Old Norse múgr (“mass, heap (of corn)”). Compare also Middle English mug, mog (“a measure of salt”).",
        "\"Face\" sense possibly from grotesque faces on certain drinking vessels. \"Assault\" sense of verb possibly from hitting someone in the face."
