        "From Middle English murder, murdre, mourdre, alteration of earlier murthre (‚Äúmurder‚Äù) (see murther), from Old English mor√æor (‚Äúsecret slaying, unlawful killing‚Äù) and Old English myr√æra (‚Äúmurder, homicide‚Äù), both from Proto-West Germanic *mor√ær, from Proto-Germanic *mur√ærƒÖ (‚Äúdeath, killing, murder‚Äù), from Proto-Indo-European *mrÃ•tro- (‚Äúkilling‚Äù), from Proto-Indo-European *mer-, *mor-, *mrÃ•- (‚Äúto die‚Äù).",
        "Akin to Gothic êåºêå∞êåøêçÇêå∏êçÇ (maur√ær, ‚Äúmurder‚Äù), Old High German mord (‚Äúmurder‚Äù), Old Norse mor√∞ (‚Äúmurder‚Äù), Old English myr√ærian (‚Äúto murder‚Äù) and mor√æ.",
        "The -d- in the Middle English form may have been influenced in part by Anglo-Norman murdre, from Old French murdre, from Medieval Latin murdrum (whence the English doublet of murdrum), from Frankish *mor√ær, *mur√ær (‚Äúmurder‚Äù), from the same Germanic root, though this may also have been wholly the result of internal development (compare burden, from burthen)."
