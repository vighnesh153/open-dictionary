        "Unknown. The most prosaic theory derives it from muller1 (“to grind into powder”). One theory derives the term from the surname of the murderer Franz Müller, while another theory derives it from the surname of German footballer Gerd Müller; both are phonologically improbable. The Oxford Guide to Etymology →ISBN, 2009) asserts that it is \"very probably of Romani origin, from a verb ultimately related to Sanskrit mṛ-' 'to die').\""
