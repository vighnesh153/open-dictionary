        "Learned borrowing from Latin mussitātus (“kept quiet; having been kept quiet; murmured, muttered; having been muttered”) + English -ate (suffix forming verbs meaning ‘to act [in the specified manner]’). Mussitātus is the perfect passive participle of mussitō (“to keep quiet; to murmur, mutter”), from mussō (“to be silent and respectful; to say in a soft voice, murmur”) (from Proto-Indo-European *mur- (“to murmur”), originally imitative) + -itō (frequentative suffix)."
