      "description": [
        "From North Levantine Arabic مختار‎ (“village headman”), from substantive application of Arabic مُخْتَار‎ (muḵtār, “chosen”), the passive participle of اِخْتَارَ‎ (iḵtāra, “to elect, to choose”). Specific application with influence from various local languages including Ottoman Turkish مختار‎ (muhtar, “village headman”) and Bengali মুখতার (mukhtar), Marathi मुख्तार (mukhtār), and Urdu مختار‎ (muktār, “agent; lawyer”). Within Indian English, the application of mukhtar is influenced by a folk etymology derivation from Sanskrit मुक्ति (mukti, “liberation, becoming or setting free”). Doublet of myftar."
