        "From Middle English maser, mazer, masere, from Anglo-Norman mazer, Old French mazre (“a kind of maple wood”), in turn from Proto-Germanic *masuraz, cognate with Old High German masar (German Maser (“spot”)), Icelandic mösurr (“maple”).",
        "It has been suggested that the English word might instead come from Old English *mæser, *maser (suggested by a putative derivative mæseren), but the evidence for this is slight and disputed."
