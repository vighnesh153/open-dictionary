        "Borrowed from Mexican Spanish mariachi. The origin of the Spanish word is unclear. It has often been claimed to derive from French mariage (“marriage”), reputedly because the Europe-born Emperor Maximilian of Mexico (which France had invaded) encouraged the music to be played at weddings. However, new evidence shows the word to have been used prior to the French invasion. Most other theories suggest indigenous roots. See Wikipedia."
