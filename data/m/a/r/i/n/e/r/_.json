        "From Middle English mariner, maryner, borrowed from Anglo-Norman mariner, marinier, from Old French marinier, maronnier, from marin; perhaps corresponding to a post-Classical or Vulgar Latin marinarius (“sailor”), from marīnus (“marine; relating to the sea”). Eclipsed non-native Middle English marinel, marynell (“mariner, sailor”) borrowed from Old French marinel."
