        "Origin unknown; perhaps from Greek μαλακός (malakós, “soft; compliant, meek; gentle, mellow, mild, mild-mannered”) or μαλακία (malakía, “masturbation; (figuratively) idiocy, stupidity; bullshit, nonsense”). The word was popularized by the Irish-American cartoonist Thomas Aloysius (“Tad”) Dorgan (1877–1929), who started using it in cartoons on March 9, 1922."
