        "From the surname of Texas lawyer and politician Samuel Maverick (1803–1870), who refused to brand his cattle.  See Maverick.",
        "Mr. Samuel Maverick was, incidentally, the grandfather of former congressman Maury Maverick, who coined the term gobbledygook.",
        "The poker noun sense (“a queen and a jack as a starting hand in Texas hold 'em”) may be from the theme song of the US Western television series Maverick (1957–1962), which says of the eponymous protagonist that “[g]amblin’ is his game” and that he is “livin’ on jacks and queens”."
