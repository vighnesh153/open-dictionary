        "1597, from Medieval Latin manuscriptum (“writing by hand”), a calque of Germanic origin: compare Middle High German hantschrift, hantgeschrift (“manuscript”) (c. 1450), Old English handġewrit (“what is written by hand, deed, contract, manuscript”) (before 1150), Old Norse handrit (“manuscript”) (before 1300), equivalent to Latin manu (ablative of manus (“hand”)) + Latin scriptus (past participle of scribere (“to write”)). Not found in Classical Latin."
