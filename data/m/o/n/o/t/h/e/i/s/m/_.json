        "A learned 17th-century coinage, mono- +‎ theism, from (μονός (monós, “one”)) and (θεός (theós, “god, deity”) + -ισμός (-ismós)) The term parallels the earlier polytheism, atheism (the simplex theism being slightly later).\nThe earliest known use is by Henry More, ca. 1660, in explicit juxtaposition with both atheism and polytheism."
