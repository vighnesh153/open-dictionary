        "Borrowed from German Methyl; compare French méthyle.",
        "French chemists Jean-Baptiste Dumas and Eugene Peligot, after determining methanol's chemical structure, introduced \"methylene\" from the Ancient Greek μέθυ (méthu, “wine”) + ὕλη (húlē, “wood, material”) with the intention of highlighting its origins, \"alcohol made from wood (substance)\". The term \"methyl\" was derived in about 1840 by back-formation from \"methylene\", and was then applied to describe \"methyl alcohol\"."

I do not want to burden you with a lecture on chemistry but there are some methyls like iron which has both a valence of two and of three. Another example is cobalt which has a valence of both two and three."
