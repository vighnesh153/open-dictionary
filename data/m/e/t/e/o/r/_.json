        "From Middle French météore, from Old French, from Latin meteorum, from Ancient Greek μετέωρον (metéōron), from μετέωρος (metéōros, “raised from the ground, hanging, lofty”), from μετά (metá, “in the midst of, among, between”) (English meta) + ἀείρω (aeírō, “to lift, to heave, to raise up”).",
        "The original sense of “atmospheric phenomenon” gave rise to meteorology, but the meaning of \"meteor\" is now restricted to extraterrestrial objects burning up as they enter the atmosphere."
