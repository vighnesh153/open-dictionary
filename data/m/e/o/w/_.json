        "Alteration of earlier mew, from Middle English mewen (“to mew, meow”), of onomatopoeic origin. Compare Saterland Frisian mauje, miauje (“to meow”), West Frisian miaukje (“to meow”), Dutch miauwen (“to meow”), Middle Low German mauwen, mawen, mouwen (“to meow”) (whence modern German Low German mauen, miauen (“to meow”)), Middle High German mouen, modern German miauen (“to meow”). Some spellings were modelled on French miaou. Meow and its spelling variants entered widespread currency in the 19th century, mostly replacing mew, possibly as phonetic change meant that word had ceased to approximate a cat's cry (note the pronunciation of Middle English mewen /ˈmɛu̯ən/ compared to modern /ˈmjuː/)."
