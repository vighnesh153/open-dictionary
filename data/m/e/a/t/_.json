        "From Middle English mete, from Old English mete (‚Äúfood‚Äù), from Proto-West Germanic *mati, from Proto-Germanic *matiz (‚Äúfood‚Äù), from Proto-Indo-European *meh‚ÇÇd- (‚Äúto drip, ooze; grease, fat‚Äù). Cognate with West Frisian mete, Old Saxon meti, Old High German maz (‚Äúfood‚Äù), Icelandic matur, Gothic êåºêå∞êçÑêçÉ (mats).",
        "A -ja- derivation from the same base is found in Middle Dutch and Middle Low German met (‚Äúlean pork‚Äù), from which Dutch met (‚Äúminced pork‚Äù) and German Mett (‚Äúminced meat‚Äù) derive, respectively. Compare also Old Irish mess (‚Äúanimal feed‚Äù) and Welsh mes (‚Äúacorns‚Äù), English mast (‚Äúfodder for swine and other animals‚Äù), which are probably from the same root."
