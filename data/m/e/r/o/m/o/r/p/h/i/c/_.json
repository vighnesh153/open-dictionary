Some results for meromorphic functions, such as the FNT, are immediate extensions from the analytic case, whereas others, such as Landau's or Julia's theorem are set in a much broader context than their analytic counterparts. Normality criteria pertinent to families of meromorphic functions, such as Marty's theorem, have not yet been encountered."
