        "Coined by American journalist David Goodman Croly in 1864 from Latin miscēre (“mix”) +‎ genus (“race”)  +‎ -ation, and first used in an anonymous pamphlet he coauthored, which claimed to be written by a person who believed in the inherent unity of all racial groups, that marriage between blacks and whites would create a better race, and that the American Civil War was a fight for the latter idea. Later, it was exposed that the pretext of the pamphlet was false and that it had actually been written by a group which hoped to inflame anger, particularly against then-US President Abraham Lincoln who was up for reelection.",
        "Replaced previous amalgamation, from metallurgy. See further discussion."
