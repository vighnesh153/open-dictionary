        "Learned borrowing from Sanskrit स्वस्तिक (svastika), from सु- (su-, “good, well”) + अस्ति (asti), a verbal abstract of the root of the verb \"to be\", स्वस्ति (svasti) thus meaning \"well-being\" — and the diminutive suffix क (ka); hence \"little thing associated with well-being\", corresponding roughly to \"lucky charm\". First attestation in English in 1871, a Sanskritism that replaced the Grecian term gammadion. From 1932 onwards it often referred specifically to the version used by the National Socialist German Workers’ Party (also called the  \"hooked cross\", or German Hakenkreuz)."
