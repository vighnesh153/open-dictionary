                    "Of the three very small specimens, the youngest is entirely of a bright light fulvous hue, without any admixture of dark hairs: the second has a general slight admixture of dark hairs, which predominate on the forehead, vertex, and occiput, while the sincipita continue bright fulvous; the arms and hands, knees, shins, and feet, are as dark as in the adult: the third, but very little larger, is coloured as in the mature animal, except that the terminal three-fourths of its tail continue rufous; and some admixture of the same remains on the sincipita, throat, flanks, and exterior of thighs."
