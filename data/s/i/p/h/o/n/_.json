        "From Middle French siphon, from Old French sifon, from Latin sipho, from Ancient Greek σίφων (síphōn, “pipe, tube”), of uncertain origin; possibly related to Latin tibia (“pipe, flute of bone”), reflecting a hypothetical late Proto-Indo-European *twi-, *twibʰ- (“hollow”) root, but the irregular forms suggest a non-Indo-European loan (i.e. substrate) source."
