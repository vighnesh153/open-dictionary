        "From earlier sloggorne, slughorne, slughorn (“battle cry”), borrowed from Scottish Gaelic sluagh-ghairm (“battle cry”), from Old Irish slúag, slóg (“army; (by extension) assembly, crowd”) + gairm (“a call, cry”). Slóg is derived from Proto-Celtic *slougos (“army, troop”), from Proto-Indo-European *slowgʰos, *slowgos (“entourage”); and gairm from Proto-Celtic *garman-, *garrman- (“a call, shout”), ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *ǵeh₂r- (“to call, shout”). The English word is cognate with Latin garriō (“to chatter, prattle”), Old English caru (“anxiety, care, worry; grief, sorrow”)."
