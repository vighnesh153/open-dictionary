        "From Middle English sak (‚Äúbag, sackcloth‚Äù), from Old English sacc (‚Äúsack, bag‚Äù) and s√¶cc (‚Äúsackcloth, sacking‚Äù); both from Proto-West Germanic *sakku, from late Proto-Germanic *sakkuz (‚Äúsack‚Äù), borrowed from Latin saccus (‚Äúlarge bag‚Äù), from Ancient Greek œÉŒ¨Œ∫Œ∫ŒøœÇ (s√°kkos, ‚Äúbag of coarse cloth‚Äù), from Semitic, possibly Phoenician or Hebrew.",
        "Cognate with Dutch zak, German Sack, Swedish s√§ck, Danish s√¶k, Hebrew ◊©÷∑◊Ç◊ß‚Äé (≈õaq, ‚Äúsack, sackcloth‚Äù), Aramaic ◊°÷∑◊ß÷∏÷º◊ê‚Äé, Classical Syriac ‹£‹©‹ê‚Äé, Ge'ez ·à†·âÖ (≈õ√§·∏≥), Akkadian íÜ≠íäì (saqqu), Egyptian sÍú£gÍú£. Doublet of sac, saccus, saco, and sakkos.",
        "ƒåern√Ω and Forbes suggest the word was originally Egyptian, a nominal derivative of sÍú£q (‚Äúto gather or put together‚Äù) that also yielded Coptic ‚≤•‚≤ü‚≤ï (sok, ‚Äúsackcloth‚Äù) and was borrowed into Greek perhaps by way of a Semitic intermediary. However, Vycichl and Hoch reject this idea, noting that such an originally Egyptian word would be expected to yield Hebrew *◊°÷∑◊ß rather than ◊©÷∑◊Ç◊ß‚Äé. Instead, they posit that the Coptic and Greek words are both borrowed from Semitic, with the Coptic word perhaps developing via Egyptian sÍú£gÍú£."
