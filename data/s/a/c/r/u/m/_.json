        "From Latin os sacrum (“holy bone”), a calque of Ancient Greek ἱερὸν ὀστέον (hieròn ostéon). Apparently so called either because the sacrum was the part of the animal offered in sacrifice or because of a putative belief that it is where a person's soul resides. A third explanation is that the term is a translation of Ancient Greek ἱερὸν (hieròn), which has two meanings: “holy, sacred”, and “big” — big being a more appropriate description of the sacrum — but compare."
