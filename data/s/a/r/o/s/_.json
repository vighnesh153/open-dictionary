        "The modern astronomical usage is attributed to Edmond Halley, who based it on the word σάρος, defined in the Suda as \"a measure and a number among Chaldeans. For 120 saroi make 2222 years according to the Chaldeans' reckoning, if indeed the saros makes 222 lunar months, which are 18 years and 6 months.\""
