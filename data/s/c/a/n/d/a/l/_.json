        "From Middle French scandale (‚Äúindignation caused by misconduct or defamatory speech‚Äù), from Ecclesiastical Latin scandalum (‚Äúthat on which one trips, cause of offense‚Äù, literally ‚Äústumbling block‚Äù), from Ancient Greek œÉŒ∫Œ¨ŒΩŒ¥Œ±ŒªŒøŒΩ (sk√°ndalon, ‚Äúa trap laid for an enemy, a cause of moral stumbling‚Äù), from Proto-Indo-European *skand- (‚Äúto jump‚Äù). Cognate with Latin scand≈ç (‚Äúto climb‚Äù). First attested from Old Northern French escandle, but the modern word is a reborrowing. Doublet, via Old French esclandre, of slander.",
        "Sense evolution from \"cause of stumbling, that which causes one to sin, stumbling block\" to \"discredit to reputation, that which brings shame, thing of disgrace\" is possibly due to early influence from other similar sounding words for infamy and disgrace (compare Old English scand (‚Äúignominity, scandal, disgraceful thing‚Äù), Old High German scanda (‚Äúignominy, disgrace‚Äù), Gothic êçÉêå∫êå∞êåΩêå≥êå∞ (skanda, ‚Äúshame, disgrace‚Äù)). See shand, shend, shonda."
