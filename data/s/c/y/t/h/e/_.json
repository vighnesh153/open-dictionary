        "From Middle English sythe, sithe, from Old English sīþe, sīgþe, sigdi (“sickle”), from Proto-West Germanic *sigiþi, from Proto-Germanic *sigiþiz, *sigiþō, derived from *seg- (“saw”), from Proto-Indo-European *sek- (“to cut”).",
        "Germanic cognates include Low German Sicht (“scythe”), Dutch zicht (“sickle”), Dutch zeis (“scythe”), Icelandic sigð (“sickle”). Related to saw, which see.",
        "The silent c crept in in the early 15th century owing to pseudoetymological association with Medieval Latin scissor (“tailor, carver”), from Latin scindere (“to cut, rend, split”).",
        "The verb, which was first used in the intransitive sense, is from the noun."
