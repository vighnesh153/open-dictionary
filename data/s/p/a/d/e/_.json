        "From Middle English spade, from Old English spada, spade, spadu (“spade”), from Proto-Germanic *spadǭ, *spadô, *spadō (“spade”). Cognate with Dutch spade, Old Frisian spada, Old Saxon spado, German Spaten, Hunsrik Spaad. Ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *sph₂-dʰ-, whence also Ancient Greek σπάθη (spáthē, “blade”), Hittite [script needed] (išpatar, “spear”), Persian سپار‎ (sopâr, “plow”), Northern Luri ئەسپار‎ (aspār, “digging”) and Central Kurdish ئەسپەر‎ (esper), ئەسپەرە‎ (espere, “cross-piece on shaft of spade to take pressure of foot”). The playing card sense is assimilated from Romance-language terms for \"sword,\" as the suit is depicted in various decks, such as Italian spada. Distant doublet of spatha, spathe, and épée."
