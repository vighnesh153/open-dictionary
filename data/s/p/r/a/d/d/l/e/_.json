        "Uncertain; possibly from sprad, an obsolete dialectal past participle of spread; or a blend of sprawl +‎ straddle or spread +‎ straddle, or perhaps from Middle English *spraddelen; a frequentative form of Middle English spradden, spraden, sprēden (“to lay flat, spread; to distribute, scatter, sow”), from Old English sprǣdan (“to expand, spread; to outspread, stretch forth”), ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *(s)per- (“to sow, sprinkle, strew”), equivalent to spread +‎ -le. Compare also dialectal Norwegian spradla (“to flail, squirm, thrash about”)."
