      "description": [
        "From Middle English spien, aphetic variant of earlier espien (“to espy”), from Old French espier (“to spy”), from Frankish *spehōn (“to spy”), from Proto-Germanic *spehōną (“to see, look”), from Proto-Indo-European *speḱ- (“to look”). Akin to German spähen (“to spy”), Dutch spieden (“to spy”).",
        "The noun displaced native Old English sċēawere (literally “watcher”), which was also the word for \"mirror.\" In this sense, the verb displaced Old English sċēawian, which was also the word for \"to watch\" and became the Modern English word show."
