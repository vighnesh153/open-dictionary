                    "Spirometry is typically the first PFT[Pulmonary Function Test] to be performed in a patient. This is because the indications for performing spirometry are extensive (Table 56-3).

There are several perceived and real barriers to its use, but these can be easily overcome by studying spirometry interpretation guides and by getting the right equipment and good training."
