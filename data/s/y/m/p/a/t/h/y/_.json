        "Borrowed from Middle French sympathie, from Late Latin sympathīa (“feeling in common”), from Ancient Greek σῠμπᾰ́θειᾰ (sumpátheia, “fellow feeling”), from σῠμπᾰθής (sumpathḗs, “affected by like feelings; exerting mutual influence, interacting”) +‎ -ῐᾰ (-ia, “-y”, nominal suffix). Equivalent to sym- (“acting or considered together”) +‎ -pathy (“feeling”). Displaced native Old English efnþrōwung (literally “suffering with or together”)."
