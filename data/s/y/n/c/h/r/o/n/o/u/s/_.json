        "Borrowed from Late Latin synchronus, from Ancient Greek σύγχρονος (súnkhronos, “contemporaneous”), from σῠν- (sun-, “with, together”) + χρόνος (khrónos, “time”); surface analysis, syn- +‎ chron- +‎ -ous = synchrony +‎ -ous; however, all related words (e.g., synchronic, synchrony, synchronicity, diachronous, diachronic, diachrony, diachronicity) were coined later, either as back-formations from, or otherwise by analogy with the surface analysis of, synchronous."
