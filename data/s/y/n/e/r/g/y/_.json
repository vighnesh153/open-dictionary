At least for nuclear systems a quantitative variable called \"complexity\" can be defined, which increases in an irreversible manner during stellar evolution (Winiwarter, 1983). This variable C is composed of an informational measure I describing the variety of the computed formulas and an energetic measure R describing the relative binding energy or \"synergy\" permitting the coherence of the system."
