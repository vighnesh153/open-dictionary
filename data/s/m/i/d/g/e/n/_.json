      "description": [
        "Likely based on a variant of smiddum, smeddum (“fine powder”), influenced by Scots smitch (“stain, speck, small amount, trace”). Alternatively, from *smitching, a diminutive of smitch. Compare Northumbrian dialectal English smiddum (“small particle of lead ore; smitham”). Scots smitch, also smutch, likely derives from English dialectal smit, smite (“bit, small portion”), Old English smytta, smitta (“a smear, blot, spot, mark, pollution”), related to Old English smītan (“to daub, smear, smudge”); or possibly from *smuddian, *smyddan, *smydecian, *smydegian (“to soil, stain, taint, blacken”), perhaps related to Middle Low German smudde (“dirt, filth”), smudden (“to soil, make dirty”), Middle High German smotzen (“to be dirty”). If so, then cognate with smudge.",
        "Alternate etymology connects smidgeon with Scottish Gaelic smidin (“small syllable”), though this is highly improbable considering the implied semantic shift that would have to have occurred."
