        "From earlier smuckle, either from Dutch smokkelen (“to smuggle”), a frequentative form of Middle Dutch smūken (“to act secretly, be sneaky”), or from Dutch Low Saxon or German Low German smuggeln. The Dutch and Low German words are both ultimately from Proto-Germanic *smeuganą (“to creep; slip through or into”), from Proto-Indo-European *smewk-, *smewg- (“to slip, glide; be slimy”)."
