        "Perhaps related to the suplay of classical wrestling, if not further inspired by super; also see -ex. Another explanation could be from sub + plecto, (meaning essentially I turn, twist, combine, or \"braid\" from under) which could ultimately reduce into English as suplex due to it being a novel innovation."
