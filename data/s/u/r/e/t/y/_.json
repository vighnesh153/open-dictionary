        "From Middle English surete, attested since the early 1300s in the sense \"guarantee, promise, pledge, assurance\", from Anglo-Norman seurté/Old French seurté with the same meaning (whence modern French sûreté), from Latin sēcūritās. Equivalent to sure +‎ -ty. The senses \"security, safety, stability\" and \"certainy\" are attested since the late 1300s. \"One who undertakes to pay if another does not\" is from the early 1400s.  Doublet of security."
