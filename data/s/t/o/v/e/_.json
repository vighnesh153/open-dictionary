        "From Middle Dutch stove and/or Middle Low German stove (compare Dutch stoof, German Low German Stuve, Stuuv), both from Proto-West Germanic *stobu, *stobō, from Proto-Germanic *stubō (“room, living room, heated room”), further origin uncertain. Cognate with Old English stofa (“bathroom, bathhouse”), stufbæþ (“hot-air bath”), Old High German stuba (whence German Stube), Old Norse stofa (whence Icelandic stofa (“living room”), Norwegian stove, Danish and Norwegian stue and Swedish stuga). The Germanic words are very old, and are the source of the Slavic and Romance terms. It is often speculated that the Germanic terms were borrowed from Vulgar Latin *extūfa, *extūfāre (“to heat with steam”), from Latin ex- + *tūfus (“hot vapor”), from Ancient Greek τῦφος (tûphos, “fever”).",
        "Doublet of stufa."
