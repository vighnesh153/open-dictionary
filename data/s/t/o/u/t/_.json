        "From Middle English stoute, from Old French estout (“brave, fierce, proud”) (Modern French dialectal stout (“proud”)), from earlier Old French estolt (“strong”), from Frankish *stolt, *stult (“bold, proud”), from Proto-Germanic *stultaz (“bold, proud”), from Proto-Indo-European *stel- (“to put, stand”).",
        "Cognate with Dutch stout (“stout, bold, naughty”), Low German stolt (“stately, proud”), German stolz (“proud, haughty, arrogant, stately”), Old Norse stoltr (“proud”) (Danish stolt (“proud”), Icelandic stoltur (“proud”)).",
        "Meaning \"strong in body, powerfully built\" is attested from c.1386, but has been to a large extent displaced by the euphemistic meaning \"thick-bodied, fat and large,\" which is first recorded 1804. Original sense preserved in stout-hearted (1552).",
        "The noun \"strong, dark-brown beer\" is first recorded 1677, from the adjective."
