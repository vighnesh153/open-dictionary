                    "[â€¦]  in the Churches belonging to Indian Towns they have all sorts of Vizards, and strange antick Dresses both for Men and Women, and abundance of Musical Hautboys and Strumstrums. The Strumstrum is made somewhat like a Cittern; most of those that the Indians use are made of a large Goad cut in the midst, and a thin Board laid over the hollow, and which is fastned to the Sides: this serves for the Belly; over which the Strings are placed."
