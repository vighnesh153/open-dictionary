        "From Middle English stalworth, stal-worth (“physically strong, hardy, robust; brave, courageous”), from Old English stǣlwierþe (“able to stand in good stead, serviceable”), probably from staþol (“establishment; foundation”) (ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *steh₂- (“to stand (up)”)) or stǣl (“place; condition, stead”) + -wierþe (suffix meaning “able to, capable of”) (probably ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *wert- (“to rotate, turn”)). Displaced by stalwart, which forms a doublet. Compare staddle and worth."
