        "Late 18th century dialectal English snob (“cobbler”), of unknown origin. Early senses of the word carried the meaning of \"lower status;\" it was then used to describe those seeking to imitate those of higher wealth or status. Folk etymology derives it from the Latin phrase sine nobilitate (“without nobility”), but early uses had no connection to this.",
        "The modern sense was popularized by William Makepeace Thackeray in The Book of Snobs (1848)."
