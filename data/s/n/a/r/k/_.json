        "Noun sense “snide remark” as back-formation from snarky (1906), from obsolete snark (“to snore, snort”, verb) (1866), from Middle English *snarken (“to snore”), equivalent to snore +‎ -k. Compare Low German snarken, North Frisian snarke, Swedish snarka, and English snort, and snore. Of Germanic origin, but ultimately onomatopoeic."
