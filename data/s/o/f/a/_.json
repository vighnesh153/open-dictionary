        "Borrowed from French sofa, ultimately from Arabic صُفَّة‎ (ṣuffa, “a long seat made of stone or brick”) covered with rich carpets and cushions, and used for sitting upon. Cognate with Aramaic צפא‎/ܨܦܬܐ (ṣipā’,  ṣeppəṯā, “mat, matting”). The word may have entered European languages from al-Andalus (Muslim Iberia) or through Turkish."
