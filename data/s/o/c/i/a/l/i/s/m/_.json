                    "Socialism is usually defined as \"common ownership of the means of production\". Crudely: the State, representing the whole nation, owns everything, and everyone is a State employee. This does not mean that people are stripped of private possessions such as clothes and furniture, but it does mean that all productive goods, such as land, mines, ships and machinery, are the property of the State... One must also add the following: approximate equality of incomes (it need be no more than approximate), political democracy, and abolition of all hereditary privilege, especially in education. These are simply the necessary safeguards against the reappearance of a class-system."

The first lien on the resources of a society therefore should be to establish that \"social minimum\" which would allow individuals to lead a life of self-respect, to be members of the community."
