        "From Middle English sense, borrowed from Old French sens, sen, san (“sense, reason, direction”); partly from Latin sensus (“sensation, feeling, meaning”), from sentiō (“feel, perceive”); partly of Germanic origin (whence also Occitan sen, Italian senno), from Vulgar Latin *sennus (“sense, reason, way”), from Frankish *sinn (“reason, judgement, mental faculty, way, direction”). Both Latin and Germanic from Proto-Indo-European *sent- (“to feel”)."
