        "From Middle English sysame, from Latin sīsamum, sēsamum, from Ancient Greek σήσαμον (sḗsamon), from Aramaic שושמא‎ (šūššmā), shortening of שומשומא‎ (šumššumā), from Akkadian 𒊭𒈦𒌑𒈬 (šamaššammū, “oil plant”), compound of 𒉌𒄑 (šaman, “oil”) and 𒌑 (šammum, “plant”). The modern pronunciation is influenced by Ancient Greek σησάμη (sēsámē), variant of σήσαμον (sḗsamon)."
