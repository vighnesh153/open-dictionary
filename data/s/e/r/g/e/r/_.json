                    "If using a serger instead of a sewing machine, remember to eliminate or otherwise take into account the seam allowances given to each pattern, or you may end up with a larger pillow than expected. […] Sergers, which create a series of overlapping stitches on the actual edge of the fabric, cutting away the excess, do not require seam allowances."
