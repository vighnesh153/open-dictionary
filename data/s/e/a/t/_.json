        "From Middle English sete, from Old English sǣte and possibly (or simply cognate with) Old Norse sæti (“seat”), both from Proto-Germanic *sētiją (“seat”); compare Old English set (“seat”). Compare also Old High German gisazi (German Gesäß), Middle Dutch gesaete. Sense of \"residence, abode, established place\" likely derived from cognate Old English sǣte (“house”), related to Old High German sāza (“sedan, seat, domicile”)."
