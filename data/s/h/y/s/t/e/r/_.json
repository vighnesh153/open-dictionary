        "US origin, 19th century. The etymology of the word is not generally agreed upon. The Oxford English Dictionary describes it as \"of obscure origin,\" possibly deriving from a historical sense of shy meaning \"disreputable\", equivalent to shy +‎ -ster. Other sources suggest the word derives from the German Scheißer (“incompetent worthless person”), from scheißen (“to defecate”), probably influenced by -ster. Not related to shylock."
