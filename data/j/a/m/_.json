        "First attested in the early 18th c. as a verb meaning “to press, be pressed, be wedged in”. Compare dialectal jammock (“to press, squeeze, crush into a soft mass, chew food\"; also \"a soft, pulpy substance”). Perhaps from Middle English chammen, champen (\"to bite upon something, gnash the teeth\"; whence modern champ, chomp), of uncertain origin; probably originally onomatopoeic."
