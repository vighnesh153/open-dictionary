        "From Middle English journal, from Anglo-Norman jurnal (“daily”), from Old French jornel (“day”) (French journal), from Latin diurnālis, from diurnus (“of the day”), from diēs (“day”) (whence also diary), from *djous, from Proto-Indo-European *dyḗws (“heaven, sky”). Doublet of diurnal  and the journal from French. The sound change from Latin to French (‘diur’ to ‘jor’) is due to the ‘i’ changing to a ‘j’, followed by the ‘d’ being dropped; compare French jour (“day”)."
