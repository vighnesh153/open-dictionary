        "From Middle English joli, jolif (“merry, cheerful”), from Old French joli, jolif (“merry, joyful”)\nIt is uncertain whether the Old French word is from Old Norse jól (\"a midwinter feast, Yule\", hence \"fest-ive\") , in which case, equivalent to yule +‎ -ive, compare Dutch jolig (“happy, festive, frolicsome, jolly”); or ultimately from Latin gaudeō (see etymology at joy). For the loss of final -f compare tardy, hasty, hussy, etc."
