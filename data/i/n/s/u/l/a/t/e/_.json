        "From Latin īnsula (“island”)  +‎ -ate or from Late Latin īnsulātus (“made an island”); see insular. First attested in the 16th century. The general verb īnsulō (“insulate”) is attested only in New Latin and postdates the English term, but influence from an otherwise unattested Medieval Latin counterpart cannot be ruled out."
