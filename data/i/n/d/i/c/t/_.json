        "From Middle English enditen, endyten, from Old French enditer, from Late Latin indictāre, from Latin in- + dictāre. Doublet of indite.",
        "The irregular spelling is due to the word having been borrowed into Middle English from Old French, and not from Latin as was the case with most other descendants of dictāre (but see dight). The borrowed /iː/ regularly shifted to /aɪ/ in the course of the Great Vowel Shift; the \"c\" represents a later attempt at graphic Latinisation."
