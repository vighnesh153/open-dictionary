      "description": [
        "From Middle English ingot (“something poured in”), from Old English *ingot, ingyte (“a pouring in, infusion, inspiration”), from Proto-Germanic *in (“in”) + *gutaz, *gutiz (“gush, flow”), from Proto-Germanic *geutaną (“to flow, pour”), from Proto-Indo-European *ǵʰew- (“to pour”), equivalent to in- +‎ gote or in- +‎ yote. Cognate with German Einguss (“in-pouring, sprue”), Swedish ingjut (“in-pouring”), Dutch ingieten (“to pour in”), Scots gote (“drain, ditch, gutter”), Swedish göt (“ingot”). More at gote, goit, yote.",
        "Alternative etymology derives Middle English ingot from ingoten (“poured in”), from Old English ingoten, past participle of inġēotan (“to pour in, fill”), from the same Proto-Germanic base as above."
