        "Clipping of introduction, from Latin intrōductiō (“lead-in, introduction”) – the abbreviation removes the second part of the compound; the first part ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *h₁énteros (“inner, what is inside”). The demoscene sense comes from the fact that they were originally prepended to pirated copies of computer games."
