It is called simple when there is no change of fortune in it; implex, when the fortune of the chief actor changes from bad to good, or from good to bad. The implex fable is thought most perfect: I suppose, because it is more proper to stir up the passion of the reader, and to surprise him with a greater variety of accidents."
