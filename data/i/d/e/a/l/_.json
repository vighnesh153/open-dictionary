        "From French id√©al, from Late Latin ideƒÅlis (‚Äúexisting in idea‚Äù), from Latin idea (‚Äúidea‚Äù); see idea.\nIn mathematics, the noun ring theory sense was first introduced by German mathematician Richard Dedekind in his 1871 edition of a text on number theory. The concept was quickly expanded to ring theory and later generalised to order theory. The set theory and Lie theory senses can be regarded as applications of the order theory sense."
