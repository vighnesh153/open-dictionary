        "From Ancient Greek κῑ́νησῐς (kī́nēsis, “motion”, noun) + English -ics (suffix forming nouns denoting fields of knowledge or practice), coined by the American anthropologist Ray L. Birdwhistell (1918–1994) in his work Introduction to Kinesics (1952). Κῑ́νησῐς (Kī́nēsis) is derived from κῑνέω (kīnéō, “to set in motion, move”) (from Proto-Indo-European *ḱey- (“to be lying down; to settle”)) + -σῐς (-sis, suffix forming abstract nouns or nouns of action, process, or result)."
