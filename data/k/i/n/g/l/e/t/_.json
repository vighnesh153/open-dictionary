                    "“My son hears tales. In the viceroy’s personal entourage, one could scarcely help it. And he tells me of them.

There are stories that, failing Imperial heights, he plans to carve out a new Empire in the Barbarian hinterland. It is said, but I don’t vouch for this, that he has already given one of his daughters as wife to a Kinglet somewhere in the uncharted Periphery.”"
