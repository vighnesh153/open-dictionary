        "Attested in English since the late 1930s, from Yiddish קישקע‎ (kishke), from Slavic—Polish kiszka, Russian кишка́ (kišká), or Ukrainian ки́шка (kýška). Ultimately from Proto-Slavic *kyšьka (“intestine, stomach”). Related to Sanskrit कोष्ठ (koṣṭha, “intestine”) and possibly Ancient Greek κύστις (kústis, “bladder”)."
