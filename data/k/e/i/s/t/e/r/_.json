        "Uncertain. Originally attested as a criminal cant word for \"burglar's tool-box\" in 1881. In the 20th century a clutch of criminal slang meanings are mentioned, including \"safe, strongbox\". \"Tripe and keister\" had been the phrase for a conman's or a pitchman's display case on a tripod. A likely origin is the word Kiste, which means a box or case, in both German and Yiddish."
