        "Borrowed from Afrikaans krans, from Dutch krans, from Middle Dutch crans, from Middle High German kranz, from Old High German kranz, probably altered from krenz, ultimately related to Proto-Germanic *kringaz (“circle, ring”). The English spelling seems to have been influenced by cognate German Kranz."
