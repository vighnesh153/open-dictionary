        "From Ancient Greek κάκιστος (kákistos, “worst”), superlative of κακός (kakós, “bad”) +‎ -κρατία (-kratía, “power, rule, government”). The word was used, perhaps re-coined, by the English author Thomas Love Peacock (1785–1866) in his 1829 novella The Misfortunes of Elphin as the opposite of aristocracy (see the quotation)."
