        "This word comes from a 19th-century play by Victorien Sardou titled Fédora. The heroine, Fédora Romazov, wore a center-creased, soft brimmed hat. The name comes from the Russian Федо́ра (Fedóra), feminine form of Фёдор (Fjódor), from Ancient Greek Θεόδωρος (Theódōros, “gift of god”), derived from θεός (theós, “god”) and δῶρον (dôron, “gift”)."
