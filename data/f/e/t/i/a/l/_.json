      "description": [
        "From Latin fētiālis (“priest who sanctioned treaties and demanded satisfaction from enemies before formal declarations of war”).",
        "The root of the Latin word is thought to be Proto-Indo-European *dʰeh₁- (“to do, place, put”), also the source of the verb Latin faciō (“to do; to build, construct; to appoint”). The nominalized form of this verb, Proto-Indo-European *dʰéh₁tis (“act of putting, placement”), would have developed into an Italic noun *fētis (unattested, but conjectured to mean something like \"statute, treaty\" or \"prescription, law\", developing to mean \"body of priests\"), which was combined with the adjective-forming suffix -ālis to yield Latin fētiālis.",
        "The unadapted Latin forms fetialis (singular) and fetiales (plural) are also used in English, sometimes with italicization, sometimes without."
