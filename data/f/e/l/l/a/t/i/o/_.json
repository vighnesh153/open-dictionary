      "description": [
        "Borrowed from Latin fellātio, from fellātus, perfect participle of fellō (“I suck, I fellate”).  The word started to appear in medical literature in the 19th century but it was still treated as Latin.  In 1919 the California Supreme Court struck down a law criminalizing \"fellatio\" because the state constitution required laws to be written in English.  By the late 20th century fellatio was treated as an English word."
