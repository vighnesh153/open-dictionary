        "From Old English feltwyrt, equivalent to felt +â€Ž wort, after its felty, flannellike leaves, therefore it is also called feltpypt in Middle English and in German Wollkraut, and listed English names include flannel leaf, old man's flannel, velvet plant. Hence unrelated to felwort, fieldwort."
