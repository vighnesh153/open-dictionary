        "From mid-15c., from Late Latin folio \"leaf or sheet of paper\", from Latin folio, ablative of folium \"leaf\" (source also of Italian foglia, French feuille, Spanish hoja), from PIE *bhol-yo- \"leaf\" (source also of Greek phyllon \"leaf\", Gaelic bile \"leaflet, blossom\"), suffixed form of root *bhel- (3) \"to thrive, bloom\". Ablative of location, because this was used in page references. Meaning \"volume of the largest size\" first attested 1620s."
