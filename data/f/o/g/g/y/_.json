        "From fog +‎ -y, originally in the sense \"covered with tall grass; marshy; thick\". It is not clear whether fog (“mist”) is a back-formation from foggy (“covered with tall, obscuring grass”) or has a separate Germanic origin, and hence whether foggy (“covered with tall grass”) and foggy (“obscured by mist”) represent one word or two. See fog (\"mist\"; \"tall grass\") for more."
