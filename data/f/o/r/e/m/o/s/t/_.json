        "From Old English formest, fyrmest (‚Äúearliest, first, most prominent‚Äù), from Proto-Germanic *frumistaz, from the locative stem *fur-, *fr- + the superlative suffix *-umistaz, stem ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *pr-. The suffix *-umistaz was a compound suffix, created from the rarer comparative suffix *-um√¥ (as in Old English fruma) + the regular superlative suffix *-istaz (English -est); *-um√¥ in turn is from Proto-Indo-European *-mHo-.",
        "Cognate with Old Frisian formest, Gothic êçÜêçÇêåøêåºêåπêçÉêçÑêçÉ (frumists). See for, first and Old English fruma for more. Partially cognate to primus, from Proto-Indo-European *pr- + Latin superlative suffix -imus, from Proto-Indo-European *-mHo-.",
        "A comparative former was back-formed analogically, leaving the m from *-um√¥ in place. Later the Old English suffix complex -(u)m-est was conflated with the word most through folk etymology, so that the word is now interpreted as fore +‚Äé -most."
