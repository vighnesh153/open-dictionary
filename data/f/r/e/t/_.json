        "From Middle English frƒìten (‚Äúto eat (at), corrode, destroy, annoy‚Äù), from Old English fretan (‚Äúto eat up, devour; to fret; to break, burst‚Äù), from Proto-West Germanic *fraetan, from Proto-Germanic *fraetanƒÖ (‚Äúto consume, devour, eat up‚Äù), from Proto-Germanic *fra- (‚Äúfor-, prefix meaning ‚Äòcompletely, fully‚Äô‚Äù) (from Proto-Indo-European *pro- (‚Äúforward, toward‚Äù)) + *etanƒÖ (‚Äúto eat‚Äù) (ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *h‚ÇÅed- (‚Äúto eat‚Äù)).",
        "The word is cognate with Dutch vreten, fretten (‚Äúto devour, hog, wolf‚Äù), Low German freten (‚Äúto eat up‚Äù), German fressen (‚Äúto devour, gobble up, guzzle‚Äù), Gothic êçÜêçÇêå∞êåπêçÑêå∞êåΩ (fraitan, ‚Äúto devour‚Äù), Swedish fr√§ta (‚Äúto eat away, corrode, fret‚Äù); and also related to Danish fr√•se (‚Äúto gorge‚Äù).",
        "The senses meaning ‚Äúto chafe, rub‚Äù could also be due to sound-association with Anglo-Norman *freiter (modern dialectal French fretter), from Vulgar Latin *frictƒÅre, frequentative of Latin fricƒÅre, from fric≈ç (‚Äúto chafe, rub‚Äù), ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *b ∞reyH- (‚Äúto cut‚Äù); compare Old French froter (modern French frotter). The chief difficulty is the lack of evidence of the Old French word."
