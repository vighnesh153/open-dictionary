      "description": [
        "From Middle English *fukken, probably of Germanic origin: either from Old English *fuccian or Old Norse *fukka, both from Proto-Germanic *fukkōną, from Proto-Indo-European *pewǵ- (“to strike, punch, stab”). Compare windfucker and its debated etymology.",
        "Possibly attested in a 772 AD charter that mentions a place called Fuccerham, which may mean \"ham (“home”) of the fucker\" or \"hamm (“pasture”) of the fucker\"; a John le Fucker in a record from 1278 may just be a variant of Fulcher, like Fucher, Foker, etc. The earliest unambiguous use of the word in a clearly sexual context, in any stage of English, appears to be in court documents from Cheshire, England, which mention a man called \"Roger Fuckebythenavele\" (possibly tongue-in-cheek, or directly suggestive of a depraved sexual act) on December 8, 1310. It was first listed in a dictionary in 1598. Scots fuk/fuck is attested slightly earlier, probably reinforcing the Northern Germanic/Scandinavian origin theory. From 1500 onward, the word has been in continual use, superseding jape and sard and largely displacing swive.",
        "A range of folk-etymological backronyms, such as \"fornication under consent of the king\" and \"for unlawful carnal knowledge\", are all demonstrably false.",
        "Sense 10, from related sense feck."
