        "From Middle English fulsom, equivalent to ful- +‎ -some. The meaning has evolved from an original positive connotation \"abundant\" to a neutral \"plump\" to a negative \"overfed\". In modern usage, it can take on any of these inflections. See usage note.",
        "The negative sense \"offensive, gross; disgusting, sickening\" developed secondarily after the 13th century and was influenced by Middle English foul (“foul”). In the 18th century, the word was sometimes even spelled foulsome."
