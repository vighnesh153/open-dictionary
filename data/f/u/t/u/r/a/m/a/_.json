        "A generalised application of Futurama, the name of an exhibit-cum-ride at the 1939–40 New York World’s Fair that presented a possible model of the world twenty years thence (1959–60). The name of the exhibit derives from the English word future and the suffix -rama, meaning \"a wide view of\", which ultimately comes from the Ancient Greek word ὅρᾱμᾰ (hórāma, “a sight”, “a spectacle”, “a speculation”) — as in panorama or diorama."
