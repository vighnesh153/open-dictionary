        "From Middle English fige, fygge (also fyke, from Old English fƒ´c, see fike), borrowed from Anglo-Norman figue, borrowed from Old French figue, from Old Occitan figa, from Vulgar Latin *fƒ´ca (‚Äúfig‚Äù), from Latin fƒ´cus (‚Äúfig tree‚Äù), from a pre-Indo European language, perhaps Phoenician ê§êê§Ç‚Äé (pg, literally ‚Äúripe fig‚Äù) (compare Biblical Hebrew ◊§÷∑÷º◊í÷∏÷º◊î‚Äé (pagg√¢, ‚Äúearly fallen fig‚Äù), Classical Syriac ‹¶‹ì‹ê‚Äé (paggƒÅ æ), dialectal Arabic ŸÅŸéÿ¨Ÿë‚Äé (fajj), ŸÅŸêÿ¨Ÿë‚Äé (fijj)). (Another Semitic root (compare Akkadian íà† (tƒ´ æu, literally ‚Äúfig‚Äù)) was borrowed into Ancient Greek as œÉ·ø¶Œ∫ŒøŒΩ (s√ªkon) (whence English sycophant; Boeotian œÑ·ø¶Œ∫ŒøŒΩ (t√ªkon)) and Armenian as ’©’∏÷Ç’¶ (t øuz).) The soap-making sense derives from the resemblance of the granulations in and texture of the soap to those of a fig. Doublet of fico."
