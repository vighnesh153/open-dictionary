      "description": [
        "From Middle English fagot, from Old French fagot (“bundle of sticks”), of uncertain origin. Unlikely from Old Occitan fagot or Italian fagotto, as these appear later than the Old French term. Compare also Italian fangotto and Spanish fajo (“bundle, wad”). Perhaps from a diminutive of Vulgar Latin *facus, from Latin fascis (“bundle of wood”). Compare also Old High German fazza (“bundle, load, burden”). Doublet of fagotto. See also: fag.",
        "The senses relating to persons, though possibly originating as an extension of the sense \"bundle of sticks\", may have been reinforced by faygele, from Yiddish פֿייגעלע‎ (feygele, “homosexual”, literally “little bird”), related to English fowl."
