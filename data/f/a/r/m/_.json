        "From Middle English ferme, farme (‚Äúrent, revenue, produce, factor, stewardship, meal, feast‚Äù), influenced by Anglo-Norman ferme (‚Äúrent, lease, farm‚Äù), from Medieval Latin ferma, firma. Both from   Old English feorm, fearm, farm (‚Äúprovision, food, supplies, provisions supplied by a tenant or vassal to his lord, rent, possessions, stores, feast, entertainment, haven‚Äù), from Proto-Germanic *ferm≈ç (‚Äúmeans of living, subsistence‚Äù), from Proto-Germanic *ferhw≈ç, *ferhuz (‚Äúlife force, body, being‚Äù), from Proto-Indo-European *perk ∑- (‚Äúlife, force, strength, tree‚Äù).",
        "Cognate with Scots ferm (‚Äúrent, farm‚Äù). Related also to Old English feorh (‚Äúlife, spirit‚Äù), Old High German ferah (‚Äúlife, body, being‚Äù), Icelandic fj√∂r (‚Äúlife, vitality, vigour, animation‚Äù), Gothic êçÜêå∞êåπêçÇêçàêåøêçÉ (fair∆ïus, ‚Äúthe world‚Äù). Compare also Old English feormehƒÅm (‚Äúfarm‚Äù), feormere (‚Äúpurveyor, grocer‚Äù).",
        "Old English feorm is the origin of Medieval Latin ferma, firma (‚Äúfarm\", also \"feast‚Äù) (whence also Old French ferme, Occitan ferma), instead of the historically assumed derivation from unrelated Latin firma (‚Äúfirm, solid‚Äù), which shares the same form. The sense of \"rent, fixed payment\", which was already present in the Old English word, may have been further strengthened due to resemblance to Latin firmitas (‚Äúsecurity, surety‚Äù). Additionally, Old French ferme continued to shape the development of the English word throughout the Middle English period."
