        "From Middle English fast, fest, from Old English f√¶st (‚Äúfirm, secure‚Äù), from Proto-West Germanic *fast, from Proto-Germanic *fastuz; see it for cognates and further etymology.",
        "The development of ‚Äúrapid‚Äù from an original sense of ‚Äúsecure‚Äù apparently happened first in the adverb and then transferred to the adjective; compare hard in expressions like ‚Äúto run hard‚Äù. The original sense of ‚Äúsecure, firm‚Äù is now slightly archaic, but retained in the related fasten (‚Äúmake secure‚Äù)."

        "From Middle English fasten, from Old English f√¶stan (verb), Old English f√¶sten (noun) from\nProto-Germanic *fastƒÅnƒÖ (‚Äúfast‚Äù), from the same root as Proto-Germanic *fastijanƒÖ (‚Äúfasten‚Äù), derived from *fastuz, and thereby related to Etymology 1.\nThe religious sense is presumably introduced in the Gothic church, from Gothic êçÜêå∞êçÉêçÑêå∞êåΩ (fastan, ‚Äúhold fast (viz. to the rule of abstinence)‚Äù). This semantic development is unique to Gothic, the term glosses Greek ŒΩŒ∑œÉœÑŒµœçœâ (nƒìste√∫≈ç), Latin ieiuno which do not have similar connotations of \"holding fast\".\nThe feminine noun Old High German fasta likely existed in the 8th century (shift to neuter Old High German fasten from the 9th century, whence modern German Fasten).\nThe Old English noun originally had the sense \"fortress, enclosure\" and takes the religious sense only in late Old English, perhaps influenced by Old Norse fasta.\nThe use for reduced nutrition intake for medical reasons or for weight reduction develops by the mid-1970s, back-formed from the use of the verbal noun fasting in this sense (1960s)."
