        "From Middle English flagon, flakon [and other forms], from Middle French flacon, Old French flacon, flascon (“flask”) (modern French flacon (“vial”)), from Medieval Latin flascōnem, the accusative singular of Late Latin flascō (“bottle; glass or earthenware vessel for wine; portable barrel”), from Frankish *flaska (“bottle; flask”), from Proto-Germanic *flaskǭ (“bottle; flask; vessel covered with plaiting”), from Proto-Germanic *flehtaną (“to braid, plait”) (from the practice of plaiting or wrapping bottles in straw casing), ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *pleḱ- (“to fold; to plait, weave”). The English word is a doublet of flacon, flask, and fiasco."
