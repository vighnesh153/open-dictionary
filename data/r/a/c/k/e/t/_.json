        "From Middle English raket. Possibly cognate with Middle French rachette, requette (“palm of the hand”). Possibly from Arabic رَاحَةْ اَلْيَد‎ (rāḥat al-yad, “palm of the hand”), although this is doubtful. Instead, the term is more likely to be derived from Dutch raketsen, from Middle French rachasser (“to strike (the ball) back”)."
