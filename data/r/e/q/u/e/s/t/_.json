        "From Middle English request, from Old French requeste (French requête), from Vulgar Latin *requaesita, from Latin requīsīta, feminine of requīsītus (“requested, demanded”), past participle of requīrō (“require, ask”), composed of re- + quaerō (“I seek, look for”), of uncertain origin, but possibly from Proto-Italic *kʷaizeō, from Proto-Indo-European *kʷeh₂- (“to acquire”). Compare to French requetér."
