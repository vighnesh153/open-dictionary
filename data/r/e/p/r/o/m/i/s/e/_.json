                    "Another alternative for dealing with customers who want an earlier promise date is to repromise existing customer orders. Say, for example, that the necessary material or capacity is not available to allow a change to the Master Production Schedule. One option is to take a customer order promised in, say, Week 3 and move it to Week 6, then promise the new customer order in Week 3."
