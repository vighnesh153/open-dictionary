        "From red +‎ skin. References to indigenous Americans' skin being red can be found from the 1580s, and ambiguous (disputed) instances of the term redskin or red skin exist from the 1690s, perhaps as straightforward references to that, or perhaps in reference to tribes such as the Beothuk painting themselves with red paint. However, the earliest unambiguous instances of the term are from the 1760s, apparently translating (via French peau-rouge) a native term from a tribe of the Mississippi Valley."
