        "From Middle English reconciliacioun (“act of reconciling; state of accord or harmony;”) [and other forms], from Anglo-Norman reconciliaciun, reconsiliacion, reconsiliaciun, and Middle French reconciliation, reconsiliacion, reconsiliation (“act of reconciling; result of this act; act of bringing about agreement or harmony; reconsecration of a desecrated place”) (modern French réconciliation), and from their etymon Latin reconciliātiō (“reinstatement, renewal, restoration; reconciliation”) (compare Late Latin reconciliātiō (“reconciliation; reconsecration of a desecrated place”), from reconciliāre + -iō (suffix forming abstract nouns from verbs). Reconciliāre is the present active infinitive of reconciliō (“to bring together again, conciliate, reconcile, reunite; to bring back; to recover, re-establish, regain, restore, win back”), from re- (prefix meaning ‘again’) + conciliō (“bring together, unite; to gain; to win over; to recommend; to procure, purchase”) (ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *kelh₁- (“to call, cry, summon”))."
