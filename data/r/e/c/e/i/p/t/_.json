        "From Middle English receipt, receyt, receite, recorded since c. 1386 as \"statement of ingredients in a potion or medicine,\" from Anglo-Norman or Old Northern French receite (“receipt, recipe”) (1304), altered (by influence of receit (“he receives”), from Latin recipit) from Old French recete, from Latin receptus, perfect passive participle of recipiō, itself from re- (“back”) + capiō (“I take”). The unpronounced p was later inserted to make the word appear closer to its Latin root.  Doublet of recept."
