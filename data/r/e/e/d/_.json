        "From Middle English red, reed, from Old English hrƒìod, from Proto-West Germanic *hreud, of uncertain origin.",
        "Akin to Saterland Frisian Rait (‚Äúreed‚Äù), West Frisian reid (‚Äúreed‚Äù), Dutch riet (‚Äúreed‚Äù), German Ried (‚Äúreed‚Äù). No cognates in North Germanic languages, but the existence of an otherwise unattested Gothic *êå∑êçÇêåπêåøêå≥ (*hriud) was supposed by the brothers Grimm. They also theorised that the word may have a relation to the retas mentioned in Noctes Atticae (Aulus Gellius). The measuring reed sense is the translation of Akkadian qan√ªm (\"cane\") used in the Bible and elsewhere."
