        "Borrowed from Norn vollj, from Old Norse vǫllr (“field”). The Orkney dialectal name vole mouse, lit. \"field mouse\", was introduced to general English by George Barry in 1805; John Fleming in 1828 was first to refer to the creature by the epithet vole alone.  Displaced earlier names for these species which also classified them as mice, e.g. short-tailed field mouse."
