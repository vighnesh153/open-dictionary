        "Borrowed from Russian во́дка (vódka), diminutive of вода́ (vodá, “water”). Historical documentary research of V. Pokhlyobkin suggests the derivation via the usage \"dilution (of distillate) with water\", as used in expressions \"vodka of grain wine\" and similar; хле́бное вино́ (xlébnoje vinó, “grain wine”) is an archaic Russian name for vodka.",
        "The standard of identity is from the Code of Federal Regulations, title 27, section 5.22(a)(1).",
        "Cognates include Sanskrit उदक (udaka), Ancient Greek ὕδωρ (húdōr) → English hydro-, English whisky and English water."
