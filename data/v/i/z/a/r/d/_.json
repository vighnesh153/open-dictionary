                    "[â€¦]  one Roscius Gallus the most excellent player among the Romaines brought up these vizards, which we see at this day used, partly to supply the want of players, when there were moe parts than there were persons, or that it was not thought meet to trouble and pester princes chambers with too many folkes. Now by the chaunge of a vizard one man might play the king and the carter, the old nurse and the yong damsell, the marchant and the souldier or any other part he listed very conveniently."
