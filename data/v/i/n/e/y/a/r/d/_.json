      "description": [
        "Equivalent to vine +‎ yard; from Middle English vyneȝerd (circa 1300), following earlier Old English wīnġeard (“wine yard, vine yard”), with vine (from Old French vigne (“vine, vineyard”), from Latin vīnea) replacing native Old English wīn (“wine, vine”). The earlier wīnġeard may have had the sense of “vine” already, with /w/ → /v/ facilitated by common v-/w- interchange. Compare Dutch wijngaard (literally “wine garden”) and German Weingarten alongside contracted Wingert. (Dutch gaard, German Garten are cognate to English yard.)"
