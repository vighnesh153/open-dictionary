        "dys- +‎ lexis +‎ -ia. Via learned borrowing from New Latin dyslexia, produced from Latin dys- + lexis, -ia, a calque of German Dyslexie, coined by German ophthalmologist Rudolf Berlin in 1887, from Ancient Greek δυσ- (dus-) expressing the idea of difficulty, and λέξις (léxis, “diction”, “word”), the root chosen due to apparent semantic conflation of Greek λέγω (légō, “to speak”) and Latin legō (“to read”). Cf. the root of lexicon, Medieval Latin lexicon, Byzantine Greek λεξικόν (lexikón, “dictionary”, literally “[book of] words”)."
