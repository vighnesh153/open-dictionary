        "From Latin dēcubāre (“to lie in a bed (that is not one’s own)”) + English -ation (suffix indicating an action or process or its result). Dēcubāre is derived from dē- (prefix meaning ‘from, away from’) + cubāre (the present active infinitive of cubō (“to lie down, recline; to lie asleep, sleep; to be bedridden; to be sick; to incubate; to be broody”), ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *ḱewb-); compare dēcumbere, the present active infinitive of dēcumbō (“to lie down; to recline; to fall (in a fight)”)."
