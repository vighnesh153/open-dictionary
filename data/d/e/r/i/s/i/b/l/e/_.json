        "From Latin *dērīsibilis (compare Italian derisibile (“that may be derided”)) + English -ible (a variant of -able (suffix meaning ‘able or fit to be done’ forming adjectives)). *Dērīsibilis is derived from dērīsus + -ibilis (a variant of -bilis (suffix forming adjectives indicating a capacity or worth of being acted upon)); while dērīsus is the perfect passive participle of dērīdeō (“to laugh at, make fun of, mock, deride”), from dē- (intensifying prefix) + rīdeō (“to laugh; to laugh at, mock, ridicule”) (possibly ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *wert- (“to rotate; to turn”), in the sense of turning the mouth to smile)."
