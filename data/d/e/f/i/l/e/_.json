        "From Late Middle English defilen (‚Äúto make dirty, befoul; to contaminate (the body or an organ) with dirt or disease; to pollute morally or spiritually; to desecrate, profane; to violate (the sanctity of marriage, an agreement or oath, etc.); to rape; to slander; to abuse; to destroy; to injure; to treat unfairly, oppress‚Äù)¬†[and other forms], a variant of defoulen (‚Äúto make dirty, defile, pollute; to contaminate (the body or an organ) with dirt or disease; to pollute morally or spiritually; to desecrate, profane; to violate (the sanctity of marriage, an agreement or oath, etc.); to have sexual intercourse with; to rape; etc.‚Äù) (compare also defoilen). Defoulen is derived from Old French defouler (‚Äúto trample; to oppress; to outrage; to pollute; to violate‚Äù), from de- (prefix indicating actions are done more strongly or vigorously) + fouler (‚Äúto trample, tread on; to mistreat, oppress‚Äù), foler (‚Äúto destroy; to mistreat‚Äù) (from Vulgar Latin fullare (‚Äúto full (make cloth denser and firmer by soaking, beating, and pressing)‚Äù), from Latin full≈ç (‚Äúperson who fulls cloth, fuller‚Äù); further etymology uncertain, possibly from Proto-Indo-European *b ∞leh‚ÇÉ- (‚Äúto blow; to inflate, swell; to bloom, flower‚Äù) or Etruscan êåñêåãêåñêåò (fulu)). The English word is analysable as de- (intensifying prefix) +‚Äé file (‚Äú(archaic) to corrupt; to defile‚Äù).",
        "The Middle English word defilen was probably formed from defoulen on the analogy of befilen (‚Äúto make dirty, befoul; to corrupt; to violate one's chastity; to desecrate; to slander‚Äù) and befoulen (‚Äúto make dirty, befoul; to violate one's chastity; to vilify‚Äù),, respectively from filen (‚Äúto make foul, impure, or unclean, pollute; to pollute morally or spiritually; to desecrate, profane; to have sexual intercourse with; to rape; etc.‚Äù) and foulen (‚Äúto make dirty, pollute; to become dirty; to defecate; to deface or deform; to pollute morally or spiritually; to damage, injure; to destroy; to treat unfairly, oppress; to tread on, trample‚Äù). Filen and foulen are respectively from Old English f»≥lan (‚Äúto befoul, defile, pollute‚Äù) and f≈´lian (‚Äúto foul‚Äù), both from Proto-West Germanic *f≈´lijan (‚Äúto make dirty, befoul‚Äù), from Proto-Germanic *f≈´lijanƒÖ (‚Äúto make dirty, befoul‚Äù), from *f≈´laz (‚Äúdirty, foul; rotten‚Äù), from Proto-Indo-European *puH- (‚Äúfoul; rotten‚Äù)."
