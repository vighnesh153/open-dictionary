        "Borrowed from Middle French démise, the feminine singular past participle of démettre (“to put down, relinquish”); from Latin dēmissa, feminine singular of perfect passive participle of dēmittō. The senses \"death, end\" derive by way of euphemism from the legal sense, as a person's death was a common way that the legal demise could be accomplished."
