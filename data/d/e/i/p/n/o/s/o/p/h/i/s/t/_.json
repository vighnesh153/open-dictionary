        "From the 3rd-century Ancient Greek Δειπνοσοφισταί (Deipnosophistaí, \"The Deipnosophists\") by Athenaeus, derived from δειπνο- (deipno-, “deipno-, dinner-”) + σοφιστής (sophistḗs, “one knowledgeable in the arts of ~”). Sometimes misunderstood owing to confusion with pejorative senses of sophist."
