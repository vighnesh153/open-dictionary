        "The origin of the noun is uncertain; compare Middle English drabelen, drablen, draplen (‚Äúto soil; make dirty; to drag on the ground or through mud‚Äù), and Low German drabbe (‚Äúdirt, mud‚Äù), drabbeln (‚Äúto soil‚Äù), and Old Norse drabba (‚Äúto make drab; make dirty‚Äù), the latter three ultimately from Proto-Germanic *drepanƒÖ (‚Äúto hit, strike‚Äù), from Proto-Indo-European *d ∞reb- (‚Äúto crush, grind; to kill‚Äù). The word is also likely to be related to Dutch drab (‚Äúdregs, sediment‚Äù), Irish drabog, Scottish Gaelic drabag (‚Äúdirty woman; slattern‚Äù).",
