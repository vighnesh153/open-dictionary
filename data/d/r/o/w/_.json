        "A Shetlandic and Orcadian alteration of trow, most likely influenced by an unattested Norn *drog (“malevolent [undead] being”). Trow is derived from Norn troll, or otherwise from Old Norse trǫll. L-vocalisation occurred in the early 15th century in Middle Scots, so \"trolly knolls\" probably became \"trowie knowes\" around this time. The supposed Norn *drog would have been derived from Old Norse draugr."
