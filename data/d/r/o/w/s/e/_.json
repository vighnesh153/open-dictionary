        "From Middle English *drousen, from Old English drūsan, drūsian (“to sink; become low, slow, or inactive; droop; drowse; become feeble”), probably from a merger of Proto-Germanic *drūsijaną (“to look down; mourn”) and Proto-Germanic *dreusaną (“to fall”). Cognate with Dutch drozen (“to doze; muse”), German trauern (“to mourn, be sad”), Danish drøse (“to slow down, be negligent”), Norwegian døse (“to drowse”), Swedish drösa (“to be slow”), Old English drēosan (\"to rush; fall; perish\"; > Middle English dresen (“to fall down”)), Gothic 𐌳𐍂𐌹𐌿𐍃𐌰𐌽 (driusan, “to fall; fall down”)."
