        "From Middle English drownen, drounen, drunen (“to drown”), of obscure and uncertain origin.",
        "The OED suggests an unattested Old English form *drūnian . Harper 2001 points to Old English druncnian, ġedruncnian (> Middle English drunknen, dronknen (“to drown”)), \"probably influenced\" by Old Norse drukkna (cf. Icelandic drukkna, Danish drukne (“to drown”)) . Funk & Wagnall's has 'of uncertain origin'. It has been theorised (see e.g. ODS)  that it may represent a direct loan of Old Norse drukkna, but this is described by the OED as being \"on phonetic and other grounds [...] highly improbable\" , unless one considers the possibility of an unattested variant in Old Norse *drunkna."
