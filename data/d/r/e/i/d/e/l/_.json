        "Borrowed from Yiddish דריידל‎ (dreydl, “dreidel; spinning top”), probably a blend of דרייען‎ (dreyen, “to spin; to turn; to twist”) +‎ טרענדל‎ (trendl, “(dated) dreidel; spinning top”). דרייען (dreyen) is derived from Old High German drāen (“to turn; to twist”), from Proto-Germanic *þrēaną (“to turn; to twist”), from Proto-Indo-European *terh₁- (“to turn; to rub; to drill, pierce”); and טרענדל (trendl) is derived from Middle High German trendel (“spinning top”), from Proto-Germanic *trandijaną (“to revolve, spin”)."
