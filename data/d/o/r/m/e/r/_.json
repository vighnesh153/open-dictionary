                    "My dorm mates and I had a little get-together in our room on the second floor. We were just talking and weren't making much noise when we heard a knock on our door. It was a dormer from the room directly below us. She asked if we were cleaning and we told her that we weren't. She left but came back a little while later and asked the same question again. We asked her if our matron wants us to clean up. The dormer said no and left. But after a few minutes, she came up again and again asked if we were cleaning our room because she could hear the noise down in her room."
