        "Origin unclear. One theory is that it originates from the word duly, as in “duly appointed [a cadet]” (part of the official acceptance). Another claims that the term is derived from Ancient Greek δοῦλος (doûlos, “slave”) +‎ -ie. Apparently dates to the first class of the Academy, in 1955."
