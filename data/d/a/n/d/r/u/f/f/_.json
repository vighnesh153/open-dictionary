        "The word is first attested in 1545; the first element is obscure, the second element derives from a Northumbrian or East Anglian term huff or hruff, hurf (“scab”), from Old Norse hrufa. Compare Dutch roof, Luxembourgish Roff. Related with Proto-Germanic *hreubaz, *hreufaz (“rough, scabby”), source of Old English hrēofla (“leprosy, leper”). More at reef (etymology 2)."
