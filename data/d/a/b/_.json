      "description": [
        "From Middle English dabben (“to strike”), probably of North Germanic origin, related to Old Icelandic dabba (“to tap, slap”), perhaps ultimately imitative. Compare also with Middle Dutch dabben (“to pinch, knead, fumble, dabble”) (Dutch dabben (“(of a horse) to stamp with the forelegs”)), Dutch deppen (“to dab”), possibly German tappen (“to fumble, grope”).",
        "The noun is from Middle English dabbe (“a strike, blow”), from the verb. Related to tap. Compare also drub, dub.",
        "African-American sense of “playful box” perhaps influenced by dap (“fistbump”)."
