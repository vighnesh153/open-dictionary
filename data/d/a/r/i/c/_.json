        "From Ancient Greek δᾱρεικός (dāreikós), from an Old Persian word related to 𐎭𐎼𐎴𐎹 (d-r-n-y /daraniya-/, “gold”), from *dari- (“golden”) (compare Avestan 𐬰𐬀𐬌𐬭𐬌‎ (zairi, “yellowish, golden”)), ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *ǵʰelh₃- (“gleam, yellow”). Compare Aramaic ܕܪܝܟܘܢܐ‎ (drykwnʾ), Classical Syriac ܕܪܝܼܟܘܿܢܐ‎ (darykwnʾ), Biblical Hebrew אֲדַרְכּוֹן‎ (adarkon) and Parthian 𐫅𐫀𐫡𐫏𐫃‎ (dʾryg /dārīg/, “gold coin, Dareikos”). Doublet of gold and yellow.",
        "Considered by classical authors to be from Δαρεῖος (Dareîos, “Darius”) who standardized the coinage as such, but this is a folk etymology."
