                    "The divine reality of the religious experience in our lives is something we cannot create or produce with our own spiritual powers even if we are wholly enamored of God and labor to disenamor ourselves of the world. This Valdes considers a selfish desire. He repudiates all forms of human initiative or cooperation in creating the Christian experience."
