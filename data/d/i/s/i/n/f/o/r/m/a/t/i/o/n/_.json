        "Composed of dis- +‎ information, a calque of Russian дезинформа́ция (dezinformácija), a word coined by Joseph Stalin c. 1923 (see the Wikipedia article). Attested in this sense in English from 1939. A morphologically-identical \"disinformation\" occurred earlier as a simple synonym of misinformation. Doublet of dezinformatsiya, an unadapted borrowing from Russian."
