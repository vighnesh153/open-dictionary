        "Unclear; possibly an alteration of English diddle; compare the use of dildo2, like diddle, as an expressive nonsense syllable in often sexual songs. Compare the spelling dil doul, found in e.g. The Maids Complaint for want of a Dil Doul, a song in the library of Samuel Pepys. Unlikely to be related to Italian diletto (“delight”) or Latin dīlātō (“I open up, spread”), often cited etymologies."

Possibly influenced by Middle English dildoun (“darling, pet”), early modern English dildin (“sweetheart”); compare Old Norse dilla (“to lull”), dillindo (“lullaby”)."
