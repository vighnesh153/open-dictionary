        "Unknown. Possibly (putative obsolete brand of roll-your-own tobacco) + -y (“diminutive suffix”).",
        "David Bradley, Australian Journal of Linguistics (1989) suggests that it may be derived from a widely used brand of loose tobacco used for roll-your-owns, Bull Durham, clipped and resuffixed with the most productive suffix for forming new colloquial words in Australian English.",
        "Suggested that it was a term brought back from ANZAC forces as a Dhurrie Rug and a cigarette are both rolled."
