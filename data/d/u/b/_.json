        "From a Late Old English (11th century) word dubbian (“to knight by striking with a sword”)  perhaps borrowed from Old French aduber, adober (“equip with arms; adorn”) (also 11th century, Modern French adouber), from Frankish *dubban, from Proto-Germanic *dubjaną (“to fit”), from Proto-Indo-European *dʰewbʰ- (“plug, peg, wedge”).",
