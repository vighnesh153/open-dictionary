        "Recorded since 1904, altering the earlier gaberdine (“long, coarse outer garment”) (since 1520), from Spanish gabardina (perhaps influenced by gabán (“overcoat”) and tabardina (“coarse coat”)), from Middle French galverdine, itself probably from (Old or Middle) High German wallevart (“pilgrimage”), in the sense of “pilgrim's cloak” (from wallen (“to ambulate”) + vart (“journey”))."
