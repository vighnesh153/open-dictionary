        "From Middle English gay, from Old French gai (‚Äújoyful, laughing, merry‚Äù), usually thought to be a borrowing of Old Occitan gai (‚Äúimpetuous, lively‚Äù), from Gothic *êå≤êå∞êå∑êå¥êåπêçÉ (*gaheis, ‚Äúimpetuous‚Äù), merging with earlier Old French jai (\"merry\"; see jay), from Frankish *gƒÅhi; both from Proto-Germanic *ganhuz, *ganhwaz (‚Äúsudden‚Äù). This is possibly derived from Proto-Indo-European *«µ ∞eng ∞- (‚Äúto stride, step‚Äù), from *«µ ∞ƒìy- (‚Äúto go‚Äù), but Kroonen rejects this derivation and treats the Germanic word as having no known etymology."
