                    "[B]eware of men who love not fly leaves neither regard margins, but write notes over the latter, and light their pipes with the former.  […]  To such fellows it matters not that they make a book dirty and greasy, cutting the pages with their fingers, and holding the boards over the fire till they crack. All these slatternly practices, though they destroy a book as surely as the flames of Caesar's soldiers at Alexandria, seem fine manly acts to the grobians who use them."
