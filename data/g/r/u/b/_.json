      "description": [
        "From Middle English grubben, grobben, from Old English *grubbian, from Proto-West Germanic *grubb-, from Proto-Germanic *grubb- (compare Middle Dutch grobben (“to scrape, scramble, grab”), Old High German grubilōn (“to dig, search”), German grübeln (“to meditate, ponder”)), from Proto-Germanic *grub- (“to dig”) (see *grabaną).",
        "The noun sense of \"larva\" (c. 1400) may derive from the notion of \"digging insect\" or from the possibly unrelated Middle English grub (“dwarfish fellow”). The slang sense of \"food\" is first recorded 1659, and has been linked with birds eating grubs or with bub (“drink”).\""
