        "The verb is from Middle English grucchen (attested since c. 1200), from Old French grouchier (“to grumble”), of unknown origin, perhaps from Germanic, and likely of onomatopoeic origin. Compare Frankish *grōtijan (“to accuse, yell at, make cry, scold”). The noun is from Middle English grucche, from the verb; it is attested since about 1400. See also grudge, grouch, grouse."
