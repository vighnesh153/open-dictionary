        "The word is often used in the phrase \"merry as a grig\". The word is of uncertain origin, though various theories have been suggested, such as a corruption of \"merry as a cricket\" or \"merry as a Greek\", as in William Shakespeare's Troilus and Cressida: \"Then she's a merry Greek indeed.\" Johnson suggested that the word originally meant \"anything below the natural size\" (compare Swedish krik and Scots crick)."
