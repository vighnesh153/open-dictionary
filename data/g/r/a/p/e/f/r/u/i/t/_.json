        "Widely assumed to be a marketing term from grape +‎ fruit, an allusion to the supposed grapelike clusters of fruit on the tree, early 19th c. Ciardi proposes another theory: one of the pummelo's botanical names is Citrus grandis, meaning \"great citrus [fruit]\", due to the size of its fruit. A new pummelo variety might first have been called a \"greatfruit\" (see greatfruit), and through the process of dissimilation, the word came to be pronounced \"grapefruit\"."
