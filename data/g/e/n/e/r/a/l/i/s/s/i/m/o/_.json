                    "Where stands Marshal Chiang Kai-shek in this conflict of opinion concerning the tactics which China should adopt towards the aggressor?

But the Chinese Generalissimo is too well versed in the philosophy of his country not to recollect that it is foolish to fight with the certainty of defeat."
