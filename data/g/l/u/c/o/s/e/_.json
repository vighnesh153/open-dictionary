        "Through French, from Ancient Greek γλεῦκος (gleûkos, “wine, must”); note: -ose comes from glucose, not the other way round. In other words, the view of the word glucose as gluco- + -ose is a reanalysis rather than a historical etymology. This is unusual for being a reanalysis that works completely, that is, without any leftover nonsense syllables (such as the ham- in reanalyzed hamburger)."
