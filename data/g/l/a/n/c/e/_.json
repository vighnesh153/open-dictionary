      "description": [
        "From a conflation of Middle English glacen (“to graze, strike a glancing blow”) and Middle English glenten (“to look askance”). Middle English glacen came from Old French glacier (“to slip, make slippery”), which was a derivative of glace (“ice”). Middle English glenten was derived from Old Norse *glenta (“to shine; look”), which ultimately comes from Proto-Germanic *glintaną (“to shine; look”). Middle English glenten is also the source of glint.",
        "The form of the modern word takes largely after its Latinate parent, save for the medial -n-. On the other hand, the most common sense in modern usage, \"to look briefly (at something)\", comes from its Germanic parent. The sense \"to sparkle\" does as well. Most other senses derive from Middle English glacen."
