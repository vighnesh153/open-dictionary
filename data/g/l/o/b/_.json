        "Possibly a blend of blob +â€Ž gob or a clipping of globule. An element of sound symbolism is clearly involved: compare such phonetically and semantically similar words as glop, gop, blob, clump and clod. (Still, globe, clump and clod may be related via the Proto-Indo-European root *gel-; compare clew.)",
        "In the programming sense, originates from the early (c. 1970) Unix command glob; short for global.",
        "In the biological sense, proposed by Bevil R. Conway and Doris Y. Tsao, by analogy with the cytochrome-oxidase \"blobs\" of V1, an earlier stage in the hierarchical elaboration of colour."
