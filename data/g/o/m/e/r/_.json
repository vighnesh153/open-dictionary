        "Uncertain. Perhaps the same as, or influenced by Etymology 3, above. It is frequently claimed that the word is an acronym for \"grand old man of the emergency room\", or for \"Get Out of My ER\", the latter story popularized by the 1978 novel The House of God by Samuel Shem. John Algeo (1991) notes that various people claim the word is an acronym or is borrowed from Hebrew G-M-R (“finish; complete”), but suggests that these accounts are dubious. He concludes that a connection to Gomer Pyle or to the \"stupid, awkward person\" sense of the word is the most likely source. The Oxford English Dictionary online (2003) likewise treats the \"undesirable patient\" and \"stupid person\" senses as uses of the same word."
