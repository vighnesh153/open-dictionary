        "Shortened from gooney, from obsolete gony (\"simpleton\", circa 1580), of unknown origin. Perhaps a familiar term derived from Middle English gone, a variant of gome (“man, person”). Gony was applied by sailors to the albatross and similar big, clumsy birds (circa 1839). Goon first carried the meaning \"stupid person\" (circa 1921)."
