        "Phonetic rendition of going; compare Gullah gwine.",
        "This particular form apparently results from the vocalic sequence in going (Early Modern English /ˈɡoː.ɪŋ/, /ˈɡoː.ɪn/) coalescing into a diphthong that was identified with reflexes of Middle English /ui̯/, which developed into /waɪ/ in some dialects; compare English traditional dialect pronunciations of point and toil as /ˈpwaɪnt/, /ˈtwaɪl/ (see twile). In some dialects, Middle English /ui̯/ instead developed into /aɪ/, resulting in the form gine; compare bile (“boil”), heist, rile."
