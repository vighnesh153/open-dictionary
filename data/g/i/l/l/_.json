      "description": [
        "From Middle English gile (“gill”) (early 14th century), of Scandinavian origin, akin to Swedish gäl, Danish gælle, Norwegian gjelle, and further to Old Norse gjǫlnar (“lips”), which also may have had the meaning of \"gills\" (based on Old Danish fiskegæln (“gills”)). The Old Norse word has been suggested as deriving from Proto-Germanic *gelunaz (“jaw”), which would make it root-cognate to Ancient Greek χελυνη (khelunē, “lip, jaw”), χεῖλος (kheîlos, “lip”).",
