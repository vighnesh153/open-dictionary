      "description": [
        "Probably from Old English. Compare Old English berwinde for the first element (which might be related to Old English bere (“barley”) or bearo (“grove”)) . For the second part, compare other names for the same plant such as English cornbind and withwind, which seem to show free variation between wind and bind in compounds."
