        "From Middle French benjoin, from Spanish benjuí, Portuguese beijoim, Italian benzoi, from Arabic لُبَان جَاوِيّ‎ (lubān jāwiyy, “Javanese frankincense”). The first word is from Proto-West Semitic *laban- (“white”), the second from جاوة‎ (jāwa, “Java”) (from Javanese ꦗꦮ (jawa)).",
        "The initial lu was probably lost because it was taken as the definite article in Romance. Compare oliban."
