        "Inherited from Middle English beggen, of uncertain origin, possibly from Old English *becgian, *bedcian, syncopated variants of bedecian (“to beg”), itself of obscure origin. Possibly from Proto-West Germanic *bedukōn, a fequentative verb derived from Proto-West Germanic *bedu (“petition, plea”). Alternatively from Proto-West Germanic *bedagō, from Proto-Germanic *bedagô (“petitioner; requestor; beggar”), from *bedą, *bedō (“prayer; request”). Compare North Frisian bēdagi (“to pray”), Gothic 𐌱𐌹𐌳𐌰𐌲𐍅𐌰 (bidagwa, “beggar”), Old English biddan (“to ask”). More at bid, bead. See also Norwegian Bokmål be (“to beg, ask”)."
