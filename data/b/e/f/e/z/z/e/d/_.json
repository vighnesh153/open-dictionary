        "From be- (prefix intensifying adjectives with the sense ‘adorned with something’) +‎ fezzed (“wearing a fez”). Fezzed is derived from fez +‎ -ed (suffix forming adjectives from nouns, with the sense of having the object represented by the noun), and fez from Ottoman Turkish فس‎ (fes, “fez”), from فس‎ (Fes), فاس‎ (Fez, “the city of Fez, Morocco”) (where the red dye used to colour the hat was produced), from Arabic فَاس‎ (fās, “Fez, Morocco; (archaic) fez”), perhaps related to Central Atlas Tamazight ⴰⴼⵣⴰ (afza, “coarse, rough; hard, rocky”) (referring to the Atlas Mountains)."
