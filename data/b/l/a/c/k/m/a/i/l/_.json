        "From black + mail (‚Äúa piece of money‚Äù). Compare Middle English blak rente (‚Äúa type of blackmail levied by Irish chieftains‚Äù).",
        "The word is variously derived from the tribute paid by English and Scottish border dwellers to Border Reivers in return for immunity from raids and other harassment. This tribute was paid in goods or labour, in Latin reditus nigri \"blackmail\"; the opposite is blanche firmes or reditus albi \"white rent\", denoting payment by silver.",
        "McKay derives it from two Scottish Gaelic words bl√†thaich, pronounced (the th silent) bl-aich, \"to protect\" and m√†l (‚Äútribute, payment‚Äù). He notes that the practice was common in the Highlands of Scotland as well as the Borders.",
        "More likely, from black + Middle English mal, male, maile (‚Äúa payment, rent, tribute‚Äù), from Old English mƒÅl (‚Äúspeech, contract, agreement, lawsuit, terms, bargaining‚Äù), from Old Norse m√°l (‚Äúagreement, speech, lawsuit‚Äù); related to Old English m√¶√∞el (‚Äúmeeting, council‚Äù), m√¶l (‚Äúspeech‚Äù), Gothic êåºêå∞êå∏êåª (ma√æl, ‚Äúmeeting place‚Äù), from Proto-Germanic *ma√ælƒÖ (‚Äúgathering, agreement‚Äù), ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *med- (‚Äúto give advice, measure‚Äù). From the practice of freebooting clan chieftains who ran protection rackets against Scottish farmers. Black from the evil of the practice.",
        "Expanded c.1826 to any type of extortion money. Compare silver mail \"rent paid in money\" (1590s); buttock-mail (Scottish, 1530s) \"fine imposed for fornication.\""
