        "From Middle English buterflie, butturflye, boterflye, from Old English buterflēoge, equivalent to butter +‎ fly. Cognate with Dutch botervlieg, German Butterfliege (“butterfly”). The name may have originally been applied to butterflies of a yellowish color, and/or reflected a belief that butterflies ate milk and butter (compare German Molkendieb (“butterfly”, literally “whey thief”) and Low German Botterlicker (“butterfly”, literally “butter-licker”)), or that they excreted a butter-like substance (compare Dutch boterschijte (“butterfly”, literally “butter-shitter”)). Compare also German Schmetterling from Schmetten (“cream”), German Low German Bottervögel (“butterfly”, literally “butter-fowl”). More at butter, fly.",
        "An alternate theory suggests that the first element may have originally been butor- (“beater”), a mutation of bēatan (“to beat”).",
        "Superseded non-native Middle English papilion (“butterfly”) borrowed from Old French papillon (“butterfly”)."
