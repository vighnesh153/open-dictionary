        "From Hindi बन्दूक (bandūk, “gun”), from Arabic بُنْدُقِيَّة‎ (bunduqiyya, “rifle, gun”). The original Arabic was بُنْدُق‎ (bunduq) and denoted filberts, hazelnuts nuts shaped like the projectiles thrown from stone bows. That usage was transferred to the bows themselves. Later it was transferred from bows to firearms."
