      "description": [
        "From Middle English bolas, bolace, from Anglo-Norman and Old French beloce, buloce (“sloe”), from Vulgar Latin *bullucea, from Late Latin bulluca (“kind of small fruit”); of Celtic/Gaulish origin, akin to Celtiberian *bullācā, from Proto-Celtic *bullākā, ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *bʰeHw- (“to swell, puff”), itself imitative.  Possibly influenced by Latin galla (“oak apple”) with metathesis of the consonants.",
        "See also Spanish bugalla (“oak apple”), Portuguese bugalho, and (the distantly related) Latin bucca."
