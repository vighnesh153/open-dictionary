        "First attested in  1889. Derived from Spanish vaquero (“cowboy”), from Vulgar Latin *vaccārius (“cowherder, rancher”); compare Merovingian Late Latin baccalarius (“cowherder serving under a farmer or feudal lord; a youth?”). Akin to vaca (“cow”), from Latin vacca  +‎ -ero. Spelling influenced by buck. Cognate to French vacher, etc. Doublet of vaquero."
