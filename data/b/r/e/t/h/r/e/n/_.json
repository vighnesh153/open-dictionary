      "description": [
        "From Early Modern English brethren, plural of brother, from Middle English brethren, from Middle English brethere, brether + -en (plural ending). Ultimately from Old English brōþor, brōþru (“brothers, brethren”), influenced by Old English brēþer, dative singular of brōþor (“brother”). Equivalent to brother +‎ -en pl. Compare German Brüder (“brothers, brethren”). More at brother. The vowel change (from o to e) is called umlaut."
