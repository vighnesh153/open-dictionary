                    "The use of gun-cotton proper (trinitrocellulose) could not be thought of, owing to the brisant action of this body, but it was found that collodion-wool (dinitrocellulose, soluble gun-cotton), which was less brisant, could be converted into a nearly homogeneous mass which satisfied many of the requirements of a smoke-free powder, but it was still so brisant when used alone as to produce too high gas pressures and too irregular initial velocities."
