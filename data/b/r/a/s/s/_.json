        "From Middle English bras, bres, from Old English bræs (“brass, bronze”), origin uncertain. Perhaps representing a backformation from Proto-Germanic *brasnaz (“brazen”), from or related to *brasō (“fire, pyre”). Compare Old Norse and Icelandic bras (“solder”), Icelandic brasa (“to harden in the fire”), Swedish brasa (“a small controlled fire”), Danish brase (“to fry”); French braser (\"to solder\"; > English braise) from the same Germanic root. Compare also Middle Dutch braspenninc (\"a silver coin\", literally, \"silver-penny\"; > Dutch braspenning), Old Frisian bress (“copper”), Middle Low German bras (“metal, ore”).",
