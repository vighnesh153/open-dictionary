        "Attested since at least 1676 for arm-armour (see brassard). Application to helmets dates to at least the 1840s, of obscure origin, perhaps a misinterpretation: an early mention in Alphonso Wood's 1845 Class-book of Botany defines it broadly (\"Eng. brasset signifies a helmet or target\", i.e. shield), and around this time antiquarians spread mistaken definitions of several other armor terms (e.g. manefaire, passguard)."
