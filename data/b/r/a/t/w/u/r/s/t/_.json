        "Borrowed from German Bratwurst. The word is partly from braten (“to fry”) + Wurst (“sausage”), and partly from an older Middle High German brātwurst, in which brāt is an unrelated word meaning “ground meat” (compare German Brät). In modern German, the term Bratwurst is used almost exclusively for sausages fried or to be fried."
