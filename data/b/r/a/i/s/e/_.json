      "description": [
        "From French braise (“live coals”) and braiser (“to braise”, from the noun), from Old French brese (“embers”), from Old Low Franconian/Old Dutch; akin to Norwegian/Swedish braseld (“sparkling fire”), Norwegian/Swedish dialectal brasa (“to roast”), Danish dialectal brase (“to flambé, enflame”). Perhaps from Gothic *𐌱𐍂𐌰𐍃𐌰 (*brasa, “glowing coal”), from Proto-Germanic *brasō (“gleed, crackling coal”), Proto-Indo-European *bʰres- (“to crack, break, burst”). Cognate with Icelandic brasa (“to harden by fire”). See burst."
