        "brume +‎ -ous, probably modelled after French brumeux (“foggy, hazy, misty”), from Late Latin brūmōsus (“wintry”), from Latin brūma (“winter solstice; winter; winter cold”) + -ōsus (“suffix forming adjectives from nouns”). Brūma is derived from brevima, brevissima (“shortest”), the superlative of brevis (“brief; short”) (the winter solstice being the shortest day of the year), ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *mréǵʰus (“brief, short”)."
