        "First attested in the 19th century. Borrowed from French baccarat, baccara, likely named after the French town Baccarat (noted for glassmaking) in Grand Est, of ultimately unclear and debated origin (first attested in  1291 (uncertain)). If by some Vulgar Latin *Bacchara, the town is possibly named from Latin Bacchi ara (\"altar of Bacchus\"; the original pagan reference of the name was forgotten), name of an ancient Roman castellum, of which there remains a relic called the \"Tower of Bacha\" on the heights of Deneuvre, from whence Baccarat is an ancient suburb. Other hypotheses have also been suggested, including descent from Celtic.",
        "Probably linked to Proven√ßal baccara, although if the town etymology is correct, this may present some geographic difficulty."
