        "Alteration of baccalārius, influenced (by folk etymology) by Latin bacca (\"berry\") and laurea (\"laurel\") due to the fact that graduates wore laurel crowns filled with berries in order to represent the fruit of their study. Perhaps of Celtic origin, from Gaulish *bakalakos, itself borrowed from Latin baculum (“stick”)."
