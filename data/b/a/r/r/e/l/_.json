      "description": [
        "From Middle English barel, from Anglo-Norman baril, Old French baril, bareil (‚Äúbarrel‚Äù), of uncertain origin. An attempt to link baril to Old French barre (‚Äúbar, bolt‚Äù) (compare Medieval Latin barra (‚Äúbar, rod‚Äù)) via assumed Vulgar Latin *barrƒ´culum meets the phonological requirement, but fails to connect the word semantically. The alternate connection to Frankish *baril, *beril or Gothic êå±êå¥êçÇêåπêåªêçÉ (bƒìrils, ‚Äúcontainer for transport‚Äù), from Proto-Germanic *barilaz, *bƒìrilaz (‚Äúbarrel, jug, container‚Äù), from Proto-Indo-European *b ∞er- (‚Äúto carry, transport‚Äù), is more plausible as it connects not only the form of the word but also the sense; equivalent to bear +‚Äé -le. Compare also Old High German biril (‚Äújug, large pot‚Äù), Luxembourgish B√§rel, Bierel (‚Äújug, pot‚Äù), Old Norse berill (‚Äúbarrel for liquids‚Äù), Old English byrla (‚Äúbarrel of a horse, trunk, body‚Äù). More at bear."
