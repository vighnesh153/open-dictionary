      "description": [
        "From Middle English baroun, from Old French baron, Medieval Latin barō, from Frankish *barō (“servant, man, warrior”), perhaps from Proto-Germanic *barô (“carrier, bearer”), from Proto-Indo-European *bʰer- (“to bear”). Cognate with Old High German baro (“human being, man, freeman”), and perhaps to Old English beorn (“man, warrior”). Used in early Germanic law in the sense of \"man, human being\".",
        "A Celtic origin has also been suggested, due to the occurrence of a Latin barones (“military official”) as early as the first century (Cornutus, On Persius' Fifth Satire). However, the OED takes this hypothetical Proto-Celtic *bar- (“hero”) to be a figment."
