        "Probably an alteration of balmy. The meaning “foolish” is from late 19th c. so this usage may be derived from Barming in Kent, the location of the county's psychiatric hospital (then called Barming Asylum) from 1833.  Before baker's yeast was available from breweries, bakers would have a 'barm tub' where they would toss in spare bits of dough and let it ferment to produce a yeasty liquid to leaven their bread.  Bakers would drink from this freshly fermented alcoholic brew and it had a powerful effect, making the consumer 'barmy.'"
