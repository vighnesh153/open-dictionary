      "description": [
        "From Middle English baudrik, bauderik, from Old French baudré, baldré, baldrei (“sword-belt, crossbelt”), of obscure origin. Probably from Frankish *balterād, from earlier *baltiraidī (“belt gear, belt equipment”) (compare Old Occitan baldrei, baudrat), from Frankish *balti (“belt”), from Latin balteus + Frankish *(ga)raidī (“equipment”), related to English raiment, array. The word was borrowed from Old French into Middle High German balderich, belderich, which likely influenced the Middle English form.",
        "Latin balteus (“belt”) (said by Varro) is possibly of Etruscan origin. Compare French baudrier."
