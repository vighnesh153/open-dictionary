        "From the city of Balaklava in the Crimea, from Ottoman Turkish بالقلاوه‎ (modern Turkish balıklava), alteration of بالقلاغه‎ (balıklaga, “fishing ground”). During the Crimean War the British troops suffered from cold due to improper clothing. When the news spread in the home front after the Battle of Balaclava in 1854, the people began knitting warm clothing for the soldiers, including woollen caps to be worn under the helmet, which were named balaclavas by the troops."
