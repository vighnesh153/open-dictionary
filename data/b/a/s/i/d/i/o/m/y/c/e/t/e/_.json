                    "The majority of macroscopic fleshy fungi are basidiomycetes. Basidiomycetes produce spores on a basidium, the basic feature that separates them from other groups of fungi. Some of the basidiomycetes forcibly discharge their spores from the basidia, which remain after spore discharge. Other basidiomycete groups release their spores by collapse of the basidia, which are not present in the mature fruiting body."
