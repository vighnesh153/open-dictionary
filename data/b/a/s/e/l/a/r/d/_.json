        "From Old French baselard, basilard (early 14th century), in English from the later 14th century. Occurs in many spelling variants, including badelaire, baudelaire, Latinized badelare, bazelare, basalardus, balafardus, balasardus, etc.\nProbably in origin a corruption of German Basler (as pasler also attested from the early 14th century), probably short for Basler messer \"knife of (made in, typical of) Basel\"."
