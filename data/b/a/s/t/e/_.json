        "Perhaps from the cookery sense of baste or from some Scandinavian etymon. Compare Old Norse beysta (“to beat, thresh”) (whence\nDanish børste (“to beat up”)). Compare also\nSwedish basa (“to beat with a rod, to flog”) and\nSwedish bösta (“to thump”).\nMight be related to French bâton (“stick”) (formerly baston); English baton comes from bâton; see also French bastonnade (“the act of beating with a stick”)."
