        "Attested since the 1910s in American English, of uncertain origin. The term may derive from Spanish bozal, a term originally for a recently-imported slave and then \"someone who speaks (Spanish) poorly\". The term is older than Bozo the Clown, introduced in 1946. Derivation of the term from French bouseux /bu.zø/, a derogative term for a farmer equivalent to \"bumpkin\", is phonologically problematic. Another possibility is Japanese 坊主 (bōzu) in its meaning of \"young man\", which can be derogatory, depending on the context."
