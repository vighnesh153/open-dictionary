        "Possibly from bogart (“to selfishly take or keep something, to hog; especially to hold a joint (marijuana cigarette) dangling between the lips instead of passing it on”) +‎ -ie (suffix forming colloquial nouns). Bogart is derived from the surname of the American actor Humphrey Bogart (1899–1957), who was frequently shown smoking (tobacco) cigarettes in his films. The verb was popularized by its use in the song “Don’t Bogart Me” (1968) by the rock group Fraternity of Man which appeared in the soundtrack of the film Easy Rider (1969); the song has the lines “Don’t bogart that joint my friend. / Pass it over to me.”"
