        "Probably related to or alteration of bogle, akin to or from a variant of Middle English bugge (\"frightening specter, scarecrow\"), perhaps from obsolete Welsh bwg (\"ghost, hobgoblin\"; compare Welsh bwgwl (\"threat\", older \"fear\")) or from Proto-Germanic *bugja- (“swollen up, thick”) (compare Norwegian bugge (“big man”), dialectal Low German Bögge and Alemannic German Böögg (“goblin”, “snot”)). Perhaps the Middle English and Welsh words come from a word related to buck and originally referred to a goat-shaped specter.",
        "Also possibly related to Irish bagairt (“threat”).",
