        "From bibliopole (“bookseller”) +‎ -poly (suffix denoting sellers in a market). Bibliopole is derived from Latin bibliopōla (“bookseller”), from Ancient Greek βῐβλῐοπώλης (bibliopṓlēs, “bookseller”), from βῐβλῐ́ον (biblíon), βυβλίον (bublíon, “book; letter; tablet; strip of papyrus; writing”) (from βῠ́βλος (búblos, “papyrus plant; writings on papyrus; book”), from Βῠ́βλος (Búblos, “city of Byblos”), a source of papyrus) + -πώλης (-pṓlēs, suffix denoting a retailer, shop owner, etc.) (from πωλέω (pōléō, “to sell”)). The English word is also analysable as biblio- (prefix meaning ‘book’) +‎ -poly."
