        "From Middle English orenge, orange, from Old French pome orenge (“fruit orange”), influenced by Old Occitan auranja and calqued from Old Italian melarancio, melarancia, compound of mela (“apple”) and un'arancia (“an orange”), from Arabic نَارَنْج‎ (nāranj), from Persian نارنگ‎ (nârang), from Sanskrit नारङ्ग (nāraṅga, “orange tree”), from Dravidian (compare Tamil நார்த்தங்காய் (nārttaṅkāy), compound of நரந்தம் (narantam, “fragrance”) and காய் (kāy, “fruit”); also Telugu నారంగము (nāraṅgamu), Malayalam നാരങ്ങ (nāraṅṅa), Kannada ನಾರಂಗಿ (nāraṅgi)).",
        "Originally borrowed as the surname in the 13th century, before the sense of the fruit was imported in the late 14th century and the color in 1510. In the color sense, largely replaced Old English ġeolurēad, English yellow-red (compare English blue-green).",
        "For other similar cases of the incorrect division (or, elision/rebracketing) of the above Italian word, but in English, see Category:English rebracketings."
