      "description": [
        "From Middle English orgulous, orgeilous, from Old French orgueilleus, orgoillus (“proud”), from orgoill, orgueil (“pride”), from Old Low Frankish *urgol (“pride”). Cognate with Old High German urguol (“excellent”), Old English orgel (“pride”), perhaps from a Proto-Germanic *uzgōljō, equivalent to or- (“out”) *gōl (“boast; showiness; pomp; splendor”), related to Old English galan (“to sing”) (whence Modern English gale). Also perhaps partly from Old French orgoill, from Vulgar Latin *orgōllia, *orgōlla, from Frankish *orgōllja, from the same Proto-Germanic source. Cognate with Old High German urguol, urguoli, urgilo (“pride”) and Spanish orgullo."
