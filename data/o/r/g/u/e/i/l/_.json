        "In older uses, from Middle English orguile, from Old French orgueil, from Vulgar Latin *orgollium, from Proto-West Germanic *uʀgōllju, from Proto-Germanic *uzgōljō. (Compare Old English orgol, orgel (“pride”). For more, see or- (“out”) + Old English *gōl (“boast; showiness; pomp; splendor”) / English gale (“sing”).) Cognate with Old High German urguol, urguoli, urgilo (“pride”) and Spanish orgullo. In modern uses sometimes a fresh borrowing from French orgueil."
