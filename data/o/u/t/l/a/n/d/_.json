        "From Middle English outland, outlond, from Old English ūtland (“foreign land, land abroad”), from Proto-Germanic *ūtlandą (“outland”), equivalent to out- +‎ land. Cognate to Dutch uitland, Afrikaans uitland, German Ausland, Danish udland.\nThe use in the phrase \"outland German\" is influenced by (or is a calque of) the German cognate of the same meaning, Auslandsdeutsche (see Ausland). The use in the phrase \"outland Chinese\" is influenced by (or is a calque of) the Chinese term of the same meaning, 華僑 / 华侨 (huáqiáo)."
