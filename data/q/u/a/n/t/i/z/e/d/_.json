                    "This is very clear for the standing waves on a guitar string: the fundamental has a wavelength of twice the length of the string, and the next longest allowed wavelength is equal to the length of the string. There is no standing wave with a wavelength between these two and so we can say that the allowed wavelengths on a guitar string are quantized."
