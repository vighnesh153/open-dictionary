Ultrā is derived from uls (“beyond”) (from Proto-Indo-European *h₂el- (“beyond; other”)) + -ter (suffix forming adverbs) + -ā (suffix forming adverbs); while marīnus is from mare (“sea”) (ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *mer- (“sea; lake; wetland”)) + -īnus (suffix meaning ‘of or pertaining to’ forming adjectives).
