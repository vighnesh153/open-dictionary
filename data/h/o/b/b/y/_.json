        "Shortened from hobby-horse, from Middle English hoby, hobyn, hobin (“small horse, pony”), from Old French hobi, *haubi, haubby, hobin (\"a nag, hobby\"; > Modern French aubin, Italian ubino), of Germanic origin: from Old French hober, ober (“to stir, move”), from Old Dutch hobben (“to toss, move up and down”); or from North Germanic origin related to Danish hoppe (“a mare”), Old Swedish hoppa (“a young mare”), North Frisian hoppe (“horse”); both ultimately from Proto-Germanic *huppōną (“to hop”), from Proto-Indo-European *kewb- (“to bend; a bend, joint”). More at hop, hobble.",
        "The meaning of hobby-horse shifted from \"small horse, pony\" to \"child's toy riding horse\" to \"favorite pastime or avocation\" with the connecting notion being \"activity that doesn't go anywhere\". Possibly originally from a proper name for a horse, a diminutive of Robert or Robin (compare dobbin)."
