        "Originally Californian surfer slang from the 1960s. Perhaps from the greeting Ho! Dad, though no evidence for this derivation is known. The suggestion that it derives from South American Spanish jodido (“fucked, difficult, annoying”), similarly lacks evidence; also vowel change from -did to -dad unexplained."
