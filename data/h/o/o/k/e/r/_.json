        "Unknown; The \"prostitute\" sense is the subject of a folk etymology connecting it to US Civil War general General Hooker, but the earliest known use dates to 1835, decades before the war. Less implausibly, it has also been connected to coastal features called hook (“A spit or narrow cape of sand or gravel turned landward at the outer end, such as Sandy Hook in New Jersey, Red Hook in New York”) in the ports of New York and Baltimore. Careful learned inference is not conclusive. See this essay, pp 105ff."
