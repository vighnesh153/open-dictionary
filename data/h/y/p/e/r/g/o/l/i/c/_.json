                    "Although the LF2-LH2 cryogenic combination is hypergolic, the toxicity of the fuel and the products of combustion have made the use of this system impractical. In general, the commonly used hypergolic propellants are considered conventionally storable, that is, they do not need special refrigeration equipment to keep them liquid."
