        "From Middle English hunten, from Old English huntian (‚Äúto hunt‚Äù), from Proto-Germanic *hunt≈çnƒÖ (‚Äúto hunt, capture‚Äù), possibly from Proto-Indo-European *·∏±ent- (‚Äúto catch, seize‚Äù). Related to Old High German hunda (‚Äúbooty‚Äù), Gothic êå∑êåøêåΩêå∏êçÉ (hun√æs, ‚Äúbody of captives‚Äù), Old English h≈´√æ (‚Äúplunder, booty, prey‚Äù), Old English hentan (‚Äúto catch, seize‚Äù). More at hent, hint.\nIn some areas read as a collective form of hound by folk etymology."
