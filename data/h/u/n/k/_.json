        "Probably borrowed from West Flemish hunke (“hunk; chunk”), of obscure origin. Probably from an earlier *humke, *humpke, a diminutive related to Dutch homp (“hunk; lump”), English hump, equivalent to hump +‎ -kin. The sense of an attractive man is recorded in Australian slang in 1941, in jive talk in 1945."
