        "From Polish hetman, probably from Middle High German houbetman, heuptman (“commander”), from houbet, heupt (“head”), related to Latin caput (“head”), + Middle High German man (“man”). Compare modern German Hauptmann (“captain”), Haupt, Mann. The Polish e in hetman attests to a borrowing from an East Central German dialect, in which Middle High German -öu- gives -ē-."
