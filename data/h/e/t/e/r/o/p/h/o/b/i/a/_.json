                    "[…]  a panel of teenagers of LGBT parents  […]  voiced concern about what they called \"heterophobia\"—they wished their parents weren't so negative and distrusting of straight people. Even suggesting that heterophobia exists for these children understandably evokes angry and skeptical responses because homo-hostile people have used the same word to support a bogus claim that gay rights discrimination against heterosexuals."
