        "From a wide variety of Middle English forms including hevene, heven, hevin, and hewin (‚Äúheaven, sky‚Äù), from Old English heofon, heofone (‚Äúheaven, sky‚Äù), from Proto-West Germanic *hebn (‚Äúheaven, sky‚Äù), of uncertain origin.",
        "Cognate with Scots heiven, hewin (‚Äúheaven, sky‚Äù), Old Saxon he∆Äan (‚Äúheaven, sky‚Äù), Low German Heven (‚Äúheaven, sky‚Äù), Middle High German heben (‚Äúsky, heaven‚Äù), and possibly the rare Icelandic and Old Norse hifinn (‚Äúheaven, sky‚Äù), which are all probably dissimilated forms of the Germanic root which appears in Old Norse himinn (‚Äúheaven, sky‚Äù), Gothic êå∑êåπêåºêåπêåΩêçÉ (himins, ‚Äúheaven, sky‚Äù), Old Swedish himin, Old Danish him√¶n and probably also (in another variant form) Old Saxon himil, Old Dutch himil (modern Dutch hemel), and Old High German himil (German Himmel).",
        "Accepting these as cognates, some scholars propose a further derivation from Proto-Germanic *himinaz (‚Äúcover, cloud cover, firmament, sky, heaven‚Äù)."
