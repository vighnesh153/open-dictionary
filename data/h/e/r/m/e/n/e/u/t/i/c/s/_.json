        "From Ancient Greek ἑρμηνευτῐκός (hermēneutikós, “of or for interpreting”), from ἑρμηνεύω (hermēneúō, “translate, interpret”), from ἑρμηνεύς (hermēneús, “translator, interpreter”), of unknown origin; folk etymology suggests a connection with Hermes. The term was introduced c. 360 BCE by Aristotle in his text Perì Hermeneías (On Interpretation)."

                    "I have included in this volume the four books of St. Augustin On Christian Doctrine. It is the first and best patristic work on biblical Hermeneutics, and continued for a thousand years, together with the Prefaces of Jerome, to be the chief exegetical guide. Although it is superseded as a scientific work by modern Hermeneutics and Critical Introductions to the Old and New Testaments, it is not surpassed for originality, depth and spiritual insight."
