In the one case, people are accepted as human beings only because they might be healthy citizens; in the other, only because they might be faithful Christians. In short, neither was heresy formerly, nor is sick- ness now, given the kind of humane recognition which, from the point of view of an ethic of respect and tolerance, they deserve."
