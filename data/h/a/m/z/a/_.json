Hamza may appear as a stand-alone letter or most commonly diacritically over or under other letters, e.g. أ‎ (ʔ)‎ (over an alif - ا‎‎), إ‎ (ʔ)‎ (under an alif), ؤ‎ (ʔ)‎ (over a wāw - و‎ (w)‎) or ئ‎ (ʔ)‎ (over a dotless yāʾ - ى‎‎). The exact seat of hamza is governed by an orthographic rule - \"seat of hamza rule\".",
