                    "In the Mamliik empire, it is certain that the hājib possessed judicial competence. […] In a first phase, the personality of the hājib does not yet stand out from his administrative character and, naturally, his competence is still restricted to the surroundings to which he belongs. The hājib is still the minister entrusted with the settlement of suits filed against the amīrs and the soldiers, and likewise litigations between soldiers, and especially disputes arising over the endowments and the fiefs which are granted to members of the army."
