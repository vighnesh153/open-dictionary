        "First attested in English in 1536 as halkrig and 1540 as halkrik, taken to be from Middle French halecret, itself first attested in 1488 as aldecrez (plural) and 1489 as hallecretz (plural), of uncertain origin. Compare Breton halacred. Perhaps from Middle Dutch halscleet (“gorget”) (see hals (“neck, throat”), cleet (“piece of clothing”)), or related to German Halskragen."
