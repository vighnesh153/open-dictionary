        "From Middle English hasty, of unclear origin. Likely a new formation in Middle English equivalent to haste +‎ -y, found as in other Germanic languages (Old Frisian hastig, Middle Dutch haestigh (> Dutch haastig (“hasty”)), Middle Low German hastich (“hasty”), German hastig, Danish hastig, Swedish hastig (“hasty”)); otherwise possibly representing an assimilation to the foregoing of Middle English hastive, hastif (> English hastive), from Old French hastif (Modern French hâtif), from Frankish *haifst (“violence”), of same ultimate origin."
