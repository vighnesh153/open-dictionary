        "Learned borrowing from Ancient Greek ἱππικός (hippikós, “relating to horses or horse-riding”) + English -ic (suffix forming adjectives with the sense ‘of or pertaining to’ from nouns). Ἱππικός is derived from ἵππος (híppos, “horse”) (ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *h₁éḱwos (“horse; stallion”), probably from Proto-Indo-European *h₁eḱ- (“horse; swift (?)”)) + -ῐκός (-ikós, suffix forming adjectives with the sense ‘of or pertaining to’ from nouns)."
