      "description": [
        "Borrowed from German Hinterland, from hinter (“behind”) +‎ Land (“land”), cognate to English hinder (“back, rear”) + land. First used in English in 1888 by George Chisholm in his work Handbook of Commercial Geography originally as hinderland, but the current spelling (following German) became more popular. The term is characteristic of a thalassocratic analysis of space (from the point of view of a nation, such as 19th-century Britain, with maritime supremacy)."
