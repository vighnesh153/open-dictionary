        "Borrowed from Latin nucleus (“kernel, core”), a diminutive of nux (“nut”).  The earliest uses refer to the head of a comet and the kernel of a seed, both recorded in Lexicon Technicum in 1704.  The sense in atomic physics was coined by English scientist Michael Faraday in 1844 in a theoretical meaning."
