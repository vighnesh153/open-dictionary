        "From Latin nummulus (“(small amount of) money”) + English -ar (suffix forming adjectives with the sense ‘of, pertaining to, or near’). Nummulus is the diminutive of nummus (“a coin; piece of money”) + -ulus (diminutive suffix); while nummus is from Doric Greek νοῦμμος (noûmmos), from Ancient Greek νόμος (nómos, “kind of coin”), from νέμω (némō, “to deal out, dispense, distribute”) (from Proto-Indo-European *nem- (“to distribute; to give; to take”)) + -ος (-os, suffix forming nouns)."
