        "In most English-speaking countries, Nimrod is used to denote a hunter or warrior, because the biblical Nimrod is described as \"a mighty hunter\". In American English, however, the term has acquired a derogatory meaning of \"idiot\"; there are various hypotheses as to why. Most examples suggest an intermediate form where Nimrod is used deliberately to mock a hunter. Whether this usage was widespread, or how it influenced the final meaning where the hunter connotation is unintended, might be beyond reach."
