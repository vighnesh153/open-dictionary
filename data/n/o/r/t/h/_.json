        "From Middle English north, from Old English norþ, cognate with various Germanic counterparts such as Dutch noord, West Frisian noard, German Nord, Danish and Norwegian nord, all from a Proto-Germanic *nurþrą, and cognate with Greek νέρτερος (nérteros, “infernal, lower”). Ultimately, these may derive from either: (a) from Proto-Indo-European *h₁ner- (“inner, under”), from *h₁en (“in”); (b) alternatively from a Proto-Indo-European *ner- (“left, below”), as north is to the left when one faces the rising sun."
