        "From Middle English nodden, probably from an unrecorded Old English *hnodian (“to nod, shake the head”), from Proto-Germanic *hnudōną (“to beat, rivet, pound, push”), from Proto-Indo-European *kendʰ-, from *ken- (“to scratch, scrape, rub”). Compare Old High German hnotōn (“to shake”), hnutten (“to shake, rattle, vibrate”) (> modern dialectal German notteln, nütteln (“to rock, move back and forth”)), Icelandic hnjóða (“to rivet, clinch”)."
