        "Mid-17th century. Equivalent to name +â€Ž sake. From the phrase \"for (one's) name's sake\", first found in Bible translations as a rendering of a Hebrew idiom meaning \"to protect one's reputation\" or possibly \"vouched for by one's reputation.\" A familiar example is in Psalm 23:3, \"he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake\" (King James Bible, 1604)."
