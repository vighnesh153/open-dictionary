        "From Old English nafugār, from Proto-West Germanic *nabugaiʀ, from Proto-Germanic *nabōgaizaz; equivalent to nave (“hub of a wheel”) +‎ gor (“spear”).",
        "Cognate with Old Saxon navugēr, Old High German nabagēr, Old Norse nafarr. Forms without initial n- are due to reanalysis of a nauger as an auger."
