        "From Middle English noughti, naughty (“evil, immoral, wicked; bungling, ineffectual; in want, needy; evil or hostile person”) [and other forms], from nought (“evil, immoral; of poor quality, worthless; unworthy; inappropriate, unsuitable; impotent, powerless, weak; useless; of an agreement, decree, or obligation: null, void; trivial; diseased”) + -ī̆ (suffix forming adjectives). Nought is derived from Old English nōwiht, nāwiht (“nothing”), from Proto-West Germanic *naiwwiht (“nothing”). The English word is analysable as naught +‎ -y."
