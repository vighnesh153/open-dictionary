        "From Middle English netting (“urine”). Further etymology unclear. Perhaps borrowed from Middle Low German nattinge (“wetness”), or derived from Middle Low German nette (“wetness, urine”), netten (“to wet, urinate”). Alternatively, perhaps from an unrecorded Old English *nettan (“to wet”), from Proto-West Germanic *nattjan (“to wet”), related to Middle Low German netten (“to wet, urinate”), Dutch netten (“to wet”), German nässen (“to wet”)."
