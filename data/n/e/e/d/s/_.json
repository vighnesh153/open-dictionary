        "From Middle English nedes (“of necessity, necessarily; inevitably, unavoidably”) [and other forms], from Old English nēdes, nīedes (“of necessity; not willingly”), originally the genitive form of nīed (“necessity, need; distress”), from nīed + -es (suffix forming adverbs from nouns). Nīed is ultimately derived from Proto-Indo-European *naut- (“misfortune, torment”), from *nāw- (“corpse; the dead”).",
        "The English word is equivalent to need +‎ -'s (possessive marker) and hence to need +‎ -s (suffix forming adverbs)."
