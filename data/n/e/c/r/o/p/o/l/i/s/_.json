        "Borrowed from Koine Greek νεκρόπολις (nekrópolis, “city of the dead, cemetery”) (used to describe part of the city of Alexandria, Egypt), from Ancient Greek νεκρός (nekrós, “dead”) (ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *neḱ- (“to disappear; to perish”)) + πόλις (pólis, “city”) (ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *tpelH- (“city; fortification”)). The English word is analysable as necro- +‎ -polis, and is cognate with French nécropole, German Nekropolis, Late Latin necropolis.",
        "The plural form necropoleis is derived from Ancient Greek νεκροπόλεις (nekropóleis)."
