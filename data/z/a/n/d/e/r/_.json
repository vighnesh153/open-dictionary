        "Borrowed from German Zander, from a Slavic language, perhaps via Middle Low German sandāt. Pfeifer states that the first German attestation is East Central German czandas (in the Marienburger Treßlerbuch) circa 1400, which he derives from Proto-Pomeranian *sądač. Low Prussian forms include Zand, and other Slavic languages (e.g. Kashubian) have been considered as possible sources. Doublet of sandre."
