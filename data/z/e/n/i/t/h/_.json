        "From Middle English cenyth, from Medieval Latin cenit, from Arabic سَمْت‎ (samt, “direction, path”), from the fuller form سَمْت اَلرَّأْس‎ (samt ar-raʔs, “direction of the head”). The -ni- for -m- is sometimes thought to be due to a misreading of the three strokes, which is plausible, though it could be a mere phonetic approximation."
