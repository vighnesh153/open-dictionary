      "description": [
        "The noun is borrowed from Switzerland French or Franco-Provençal luge, from Medieval Latin scludia, from Late Latin sclodia, of Celtic origin, from Gaulish *stludio, possibly from Proto-Indo-European *sleydʰ- (“to slide, slip; to be slick or slippery”). If so, it is related to sled and sleigh.",
        "Sense 2.2 (“drinking utensil”) is from its resemblance to the tracks on which luges race.",
        "The verb is derived from the noun."
