        "Borrowed from Scots lum, Early Scots lumb; further etymology uncertain, possibly from Old French lum (“light”) (compare French lumière (“light; cavity or channel within a tube or tubular organ, lumen; opening”)), from Latin lūmen (“light; light source; opening through which light can penetrate such as an air-hole or window; opening or orifice in a water-pipe or funnel”), ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *lewk- (“bright; to see; to shine”). The word is possibly also related to Welsh llumon (“chimney”) (obsolete)."
