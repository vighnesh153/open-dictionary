        "From logo- (prefix meaning ‘word; speech’) +‎ -rrhea (suffix meaning ‘flowing’), probably modelled after diarrhea. Logo- is derived from Ancient Greek λόγος (lógos, “word; speech; utterance”) (from λέγω (légō, “to say, speak; to arrange; to gather”), from Proto-Indo-European *leǵ- (“to collect, gather”)), while -rrhea is from ῥοία (rhoía, “a flow, flux”) (from ῥέω (rhéō, “to flow”), from Proto-Indo-European *srew- (“to flow”))."
