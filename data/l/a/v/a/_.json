        "From Italian, from Neapolitan lava (“lava”, but also “downpour overflowing the streets”). Likely in the sense of “landslide, torrent” from Latin labes (“fall”), compare labina (“avalanche, landslide”). A supposed relation with lavare (“to wash”) is now widely discredited. Neither is there probably any relation with Arabic لابة‎ (lāba, “black volcanic rock”)."
