        "From New Latin, from Latin laudō (“I praise”), or ladanum (“a gum resin”), from Ancient Greek λάδανον (ládanon). Originally the same word as ladanum, labdanum, compare French laudanum, Italian laudano, ladano. See ladanum.",
        "Used by Paracelsus to refer to ladanum gum, and to a compound recipe containing pearls, but apparently not to any preparation of opium; this modern sense was introduced by his followers (Sigerist 1941:540–1)."
