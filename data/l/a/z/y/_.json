        "Attested since 1540, origin uncertain. Probably from Low German and Middle Low German lasich (“slack, feeble, lazy”), from las, from Proto-Germanic *lasiwaz, *laskaz (“feeble, weak”), from Proto-Indo-European *las- (“weak”).",
        "Akin to Dutch leuzig (“lazy”), Old Norse lasinn (“limpy, tired, weak”), Old English lesu, lysu (“false, evil, base”). More at lush.",
        "An alternate etymology traces lazy to Early Modern English laysy, a derivative of lay (plural lays +‎ -y) in the same way that tipsy is derived from tip. See lay."
