        "From Late Middle English lainer, lainere, lanyer (“strap or thong used to fasten armour, shields, clothing, etc.”) [and other forms] (with the ending modified in the 17th century under the influence of yard), from Old French laniere, lasniere (“thong, lash”) (modern French lanière (“lanyard, strap; (by extension) a strip”)), from lasne (“strap, thong; noose; snare”), a metathetic alteration of nasle, nasliere (“strap, thong”), influenced by lane (“wool”), las (“lace of a boot, shoe, etc.”), or laz (“snare, trap; pitfall”); nasliere is derived from Old Dutch *nastila (“headband; tie”), from Proto-West Germanic *nastilu (“strap; thread; tie”), from Proto-Indo-European *ned- (“to tie together”). The English word is cognate with Old High German nestila (“band, headband; strap”) (modern German Nestel (“lace; strap; string”)), Old Norse nesta (“brace; fastener, strap”)."
