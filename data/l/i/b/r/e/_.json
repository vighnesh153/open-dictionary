        "Sense 1 (“especially of the will: free, independent”) is borrowed from French libre (“at liberty, free; clear, free, vacant; free, without obligation”), from Latin līber (“free, unrestricted”), ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *h₁lewdʰ- (“people”).",
        "Senses 2 (“(software) with very few limitations on distribution or improvement”) and 3 (\"not enslaved\") are either borrowed from the French word or the Spanish libre (“free: not enslaved or imprisoned; without obligation; unconstrained by distrust or timidity; not containing, without”), from the same Latin etymon as above."
