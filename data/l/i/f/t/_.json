        "From Middle English liften, lyften, from Old Norse lypta (‚Äúto lift, air‚Äù, literally ‚Äúto raise in the air‚Äù), from Proto-Germanic *luftijanƒÖ (‚Äúto raise in the air‚Äù), related to *luftuz (‚Äúroof, air‚Äù), perhaps from Proto-Indo-European *lewp- (‚Äúto peel, break off, damage‚Äù) or from a root meaning roof (see *luftuz). Cognate with Danish and Norwegian Bokm√•l l√∏fte (‚Äúto lift‚Äù), Norwegian Nynorsk and Swedish lyfta (‚Äúto lift‚Äù), German l√ºften (‚Äúto air, lift‚Äù), Old English lyft (‚Äúair‚Äù). See above. 1851 for the noun sense \"a mechanical device for vertical transport\".",
        "(To steal): For this sense Cleasby suggests perhaps a relation to the root of Gothic êå∑êåªêåπêçÜêçÑêåøêçÉ (hliftus) \"thief\", cognate with Latin cleptus and Greek Œ∫ŒªŒ≠œÄœÑœâ (kl√©pt≈ç))."
