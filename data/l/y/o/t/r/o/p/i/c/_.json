        "lyo- +‎ -tropic, c. 1910, presumably borrowed from German, or by analogy with earlier lyo- terms such as lyophilic or lyophilization (1894). From Ancient Greek λύω (lúō, “to loosen, to dissolve”) + τροπικός (tropikós, “of or pertaining to a turn or change; or the solstice; or a trope or figure; tropic; tropical; etc.”), from τροπή (tropḗ, “turn; solstice; trope”)."

Sulphates, tartrates, etc., raise the point of solidification, decrease the period of solidification, and increase the rate of change of the viscosity with the time. They therefore help the solidification.”"
