        "1894, US. lyo- +‎ philos +‎ -ization (alternatively analyzed as lyophilize +‎ -ation), from Ancient Greek λύω (lúō, “to loosen, to dissolve”) + φίλος (phílos, “beloved”) + -ίζειν (-ízein) + Latin -ātiō, due to the dried product being able to rapidly reabsorb the solvent and restore the original substance, hence “lyophil” (solvent-loving). Popularized from 1960 by Louis R. Rey. Cognates in other European languages via same construction."
