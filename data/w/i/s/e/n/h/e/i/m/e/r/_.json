        "First used in the early 20th c. From wise + the German demonymic ending -enheimer.",
        "The form might be an alteration of the similarly formed and synonymous German Schlauberger (19th c.), possibly influenced by Pappenheimer (“person known for some behaviour; crony”) and/or involving a pun on Waisenheim (“orphanage”). On the other hand, the surname Weisenheimer actually exists, both in Germany and the US. It goes back to the towns of Weisenheim am Berg and Weisenheim am Sand (both in Palatinate)."
