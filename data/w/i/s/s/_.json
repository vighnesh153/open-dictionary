        "Perhaps an alteration of wis, taken from the incorrect division of iwis (“sure(ly), certain(ly)”) from Middle English iwis, ywis (“sure(ly), certain(ly)”), from Old English ġewis (“certain, positive, sure”)) as \"I wis\", which was mistaken for a verb. Perhaps from (certainly akin to) Old English witan (“to know”). See wit."
