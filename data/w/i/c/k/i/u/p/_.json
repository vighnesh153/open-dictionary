        "Wickiup-like structures were built by many Native American peoples throughout the Southwestern United States, and terms similar to wickiup are present \"among Native Americans in Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, Idaho, and California\", but the source of the word appears to be Fox wîkiyâpi (“house”). Alternatively, it may be a variant of wikiwam (“wigwam”). Either way, its ultimate origin is the Proto-Algonquian root *wi·kiwa·ʔmi (“house”). Doublet of wigwam."
