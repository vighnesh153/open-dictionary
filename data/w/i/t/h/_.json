        "From Middle English with, from Old English wi√æ (‚Äúagainst, opposite, toward, with‚Äù), from Proto-Germanic *wi√æi, a shortened form of Proto-Germanic *wi√ærƒÖ (‚Äúagainst‚Äù). In Middle English, the word shifted to denote association rather than opposition, displacing Middle English mid (‚Äúwith‚Äù), from Old English mid (‚Äúwith‚Äù), from Proto-Germanic *midi; an earlier model of this meaning shift exists in cognate Old Norse vi√∞; elsewhere, the converse meaning shift is exposed by Old South Arabian ê©®ê©∫ê©¨‚Äé (byn, ‚Äúbetween, amid‚Äù) spawning Old South Arabian ê©®ê©¨‚Äé (bn, ‚Äúagainst‚Äù) and even likewise frequent reverse meaning ê©®ê©¨‚Äé (bn, ‚Äúfrom‚Äù)."
