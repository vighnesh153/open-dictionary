      "description": [
        "From Middle English wēlden, which combines forms from two closely related verbs: Old English wealdan (“to control, rule”) (strong class 7) and Old English wieldan (“to control, subdue”) (weak). Both verbs ultimately derive from Proto-West Germanic *waldan, from Proto-Germanic *waldaną (“to rule”)",
        "The reason for the merger was that in Middle English the -d in the stem made it hard to distinguish between strong and weak forms in the past tense."
