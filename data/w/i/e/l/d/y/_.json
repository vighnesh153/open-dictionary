        "From Middle English wẹ̄ldī, weldy (“agile, vigorous; of a shield: easy or satisfying to wield”), from wẹ̄lden, welde (“to govern, preside over, reign, rule; to command, control, dominate; to dwell, reside; to accomplish, bring about; to overcome, prevail; to handle (a tool, weapon, etc.), use”), from Old English wylde (“controlling, dominant”), from Proto-Germanic *waldiz (“manageable; powerful”), possibly ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *h₂welh₁- (“to rule; powerful, strong”); analysable as wield +‎ -y. Later uses of sense 2 (“capable of being easily wielded”) are likely a back-formation from unwieldy."
