                    "The idea behind the cruiser is a vessel in which my wife and I could cruise in comfort the year round, and yet fast enough to take part in an occasional ocean race, a vessel that in meeting a head wind in the channel could make good on her passage instead of spending weeks weatherbound. For having left trading schooners and ketches and wholesome yachts weatherbound in Dover when in a little 6-metre, which made the passage to Newhaven dead to windward in 12 hours, I realise that the ability to go to windward is very desirable however much cruising men may scorn it, for it was not the weather, although it blew hard, that kept these vessels weatherbound, but the knowledge that with the wind and sea against them they would only fetch back to Dover again after a long tack off and on."
