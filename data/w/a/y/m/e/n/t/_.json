        "From Middle English weymenten, waymenten, from Old Northern French waimenter (“to lament”) (compare Old French guaimenter, gaimenter (“to lament”)), a conflation of wai, guai (“woe”), from Frankish *wai, *wē (“woe”) from Proto-Germanic *wai (“woe”), and Latin lamentari (“to lament”). Akin to Old High German wē (“woe”) (German Weh \"woe, pain\"), Old English wā (“woe”). More at woe, lament."
