        "From Ancient Greek ἐπώνῠμος (epṓnumos, “concerning giving one’s name to something; named in a significant manner; surnamed”) + English -ous (suffix forming adjectives from nouns, denoting pertinence or relation). Ἐπώνῠμος (Epṓnumos) is derived from ἐπί- (epí-, prefix meaning ‘on, upon’) (ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *h₁epi (“at; near; on”)) + Aeolic Greek ὄνῠμᾰ (ónuma) (from Ancient Greek ὄνομᾰ (ónoma, “a name”), ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *h₁nómn̥ (“a name”), perhaps from *h₃neh₃- (“to name”))."
