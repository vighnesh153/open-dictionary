        "From epi- (prefix meaning ‘above, on, over; in addition to’) +‎ phenomenon. Phenomenon is derived from Late Latin phaenomenon (“appearance”), Latin *phaenomenon (only attested in the plural form phaenomena), from Ancient Greek φαινόμενον (phainómenon, “thing that appears in one’s view; appearance; phenomenon”), a noun use of the neuter singular form of φαινόμενος (phainómenos), the present middle or passive participle of φαίνω (phaínō, “to cause to appear; to reveal, show, uncover; to expound”), ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *bʰeh₂- (“to glow with light, to shine”).",
        "The plural epiphenomena is derived from epi- +‎ phenomena."
