        "From Middle French evitable (modern French évitable), from Latin ēvītābilis (“avoidable”), from ēvītō (“to avoid”) + -bilis (“-able”, suffix meaning ‘able or worthy to be’). Ēvītō is derived from ē- (“prefix meaning ‘out’”) + vītō (“to avoid, evade; to shun”) (possibly from Proto-Indo-European *dwidʰeh₁- (“separate, set apart”), a compound of *dwi- (“two”) + *dʰeh₁- (“to put”))."
