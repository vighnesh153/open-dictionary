    {
      "description": [
        "From Middle English extenuat (“(medicine) made thin, emaciated”), from Latin extenuātus (“diminished, reduced, thinned”), the perfect passive participle of extenuō (“to diminish, reduce, thin”), from ex- (intensifying prefix) + tenuō (“to enfeeble, weaken, wear down; to lessen, reduce; to make thin”). Tenuō is derived from tenuis (“fine, slender, thin; feeble, weak”) (ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *tenh₂- (“to extend, stretch; thin”)) + -ō (suffix forming regular first-conjugation verbs)."
