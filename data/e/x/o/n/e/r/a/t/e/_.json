      "description": [
        "From Middle English exoneraten (attested in past participle exonerated), from Latin exonerāt-, the participle stem of exonerāre, from exonerō (“to discharge, unload; to exonerate”), from ex- (prefix denoting privation) + onerō (“to burden, lade; to load”) (from onus (“burden, load”), from Proto-Indo-European *h₃énh₂os (“burden, load”), from *h₃enh₂- (“to charge, onerate”)). The English word is cognate with French exonérer."
