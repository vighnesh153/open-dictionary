      "description": [
        "From Middle English ese, eise, aise, from Anglo-Norman ese (‚Äúease‚Äù), from Old French eise, aise (‚Äúelbow room; opportunity‚Äù), of uncertain and obscure origin. Apparently related to Proven√ßal ais, Italian agio and asio,  Sicilian aciu and  Portuguese azo. Sometimes ascribed to Vulgar Latin *ƒÅsia or *ƒÅsium, possibly from Latin ƒÅnsa (‚Äúhandle, haft‚Äù) or Frankish *ansiju (‚Äúhandle, loophole, eyelet; cup-handle; arms akimbo, elbow room‚Äù), but more often derived from Vulgar Latin *adjace(m), from Latin adjacƒìns (‚Äúadjacent, neighbouring‚Äù), present participle of adjace≈ç (‚Äúlie next to, border on‚Äù), though the forms and senses are difficult to trace clearly.",
        "Alternatively, possibly from a non-Latin source such as Germanic or Celtic on the basis of the conflicting forms which appear in various Romance languages. Compare Old English ƒ´e√æe (‚Äúeasy‚Äù), Gothic êå∞êå∂êå¥êçÑêåπ (azƒìti, ‚Äúease; pleasure‚Äù), *êå∞êå∂êå¥êçÑêçÉ (*azƒìts, ‚Äúeasy‚Äù), Breton eaz, ez (‚Äúeasy‚Äù), Irish adhais (‚Äúeasy; leisure‚Äù). See also eath.",
        "The verb is from Middle English esen, ultimately of the same origin."
