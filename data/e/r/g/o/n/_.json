        "Borrowed from Ancient Greek ἔργον (érgon). Doublet of work.",

        "In classical thermodynamics, the term is coined as translating German Werk. Rudolf Clausius (1864) made a technical distinction between Werk and  Arbeit, both translating to English \"work\", and suggested Ergon for the purposes of the translation of his terminology into other modern languages."
