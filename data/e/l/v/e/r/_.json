        "Variant of eelfare, originally \"brood of young eels\", from Middle English *elfare, *elvare, from el (“eel”) +‎ fare (“group of journeyers”). Equivalent to eel +‎ fare.",
        "Liberman instead connects the second element of this word to a putative Old English suffix *-for(e), but there is no need to posit such a suffix when the traditional etymology suffices. Furthermore, such a suffix is not securely attested, and the spelling of the word's earliest attestation (as yele fare, ell vare) implies Middle English /aː/."
