        "From the earlier form elritch, of uncertain origin. The second element, -ritch, is generally taken to be Old English rīċe (“realm, kingdom”) (see riche). Some think that the first element, el-, derives from an Old English root meaning \"foreign, strange, other\" (related to Old English ellende and modern English else); others think that it derives from elf. Reintroduced into popular literature by the writings of H. P. Lovecraft."
