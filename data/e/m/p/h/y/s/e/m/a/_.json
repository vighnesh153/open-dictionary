        "Multiple origins. Partially from post-Classical Latin emphysema (“swelling”), from Ancient Greek ἐμφυσᾶν (emphusân, “puff up”), from ἐν (en, “in”) + φῦσα (phûsa, “wind”). Also borrowed from Middle French emphysema, from the same Latin source; compare French emphysème. Attested from the late 16th century."
