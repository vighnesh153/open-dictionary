        "From Middle English emeraude, borrowed from Old French esmeraude, from Vulgar Latin *smaralda, *smaraldus, *smaraudus, variant of Latin smaragdus, from Ancient Greek σμάραγδος (smáragdos), μάραγδος (máragdos), from a Semitic language. Compare Hebrew בָּרֶקֶת‎ (bareket, “emerald, flashing gem”), Akkadian 𒁀𒊏𒄣 (baraqu, literally “scintillation”), Arabic بَرْق‎ (barq, literally “flashing”), Egyptian bwyrqꜣ (literally “to sparkle”):",
        "and loanwords with Semitic etymon such as Sanskrit मरकत (marakata) and Persian زمرد‎ (zomorrod) (whence Turkish zümrüt and Russian изумру́д (izumrúd))."
