        "Attested since the 1500s in the sense \"indulged child\" and since the 1530s in the sense \"animal companion\". From Scots and dialectal Northern English, of unclear origin. Perhaps a back-formation of petty, pety (“little, small”), a term formerly used to describe children and animals (e.g. pet lambs). Alternatively, perhaps a borrowing of Scottish Gaelic peata, from Middle Irish petta, peta (“pet, lap-dog”), of uncertain (possibly pre-Indo-European substrate) origin. Compare peat (“pet, darling, woman”).",
