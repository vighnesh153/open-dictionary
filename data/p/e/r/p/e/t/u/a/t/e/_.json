        "From Late Middle English perpetuate (adjective only), borrowed from Latin perpetuātus (“perpetuated”) + English -ate (suffix meaning ‘characterized by [the specified thing]’ forming adjectives, and ‘to act in [the specified manner]’ forming verbs). Perpetuātus is the perfect passive participle of perpetuō (“to cause to continue uninterruptedly, to proceed with continually, to make perpetual, perpetuate”), from perpetuus (“everlasting, perpetual”) (from per- (prefix meaning ‘very’) + petō (“to ask, request; to look for; to make for (somewhere)”) (ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *peth₂- (“to spread out; to fly”)) + -uus (suffix forming adjectives)) + -ō (suffix forming regular first-conjugation verbs)."
