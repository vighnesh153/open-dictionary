        "From Late Middle English peregrinacioun, peregrinacion (“journey; pilgrimage; (figuratively) human journey through life”), from Anglo-Norman peregrinaciun (“human journey through life”), peregrination (“pilgrimage; overseas travel”), and Old French peregrinacion, peregrination (“pilgrimage; overseas travel”) (modern French pérégrination), and from their etymon Latin peregrīnātiō (“overseas sojourn or travel; (Late Latin) pilgrimage; sojourn; human journey through life”), from peregrīnātus (“living or travelling overseas”) + -iō (suffix forming abstract nouns). Peregrīnātus is the perfect passive participle of peregrīnor (“to live or travel overseas; to be overseas; to roam, rove; to be a stranger”), from peregrīnus (“alien, foreign; exotic”) (from peregrē̆ (“abroad; from abroad; heading abroad”) + -īnus (suffix forming adjectives meaning ‘of or pertaining to’)) + -or (suffix forming first-person singular present passive indicative verbs)."
