        "From perihelium (“perihelion”) (obsolete) +‎ -on (suffix forming nouns) (from Ancient Greek -ον (-on)). Perihelium is borrowed from Late Latin perihelium, from Ancient Greek περί- (perí-) (a variant of περι- (peri-, prefix meaning ‘around; surrounding’), ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *per- (“before, in front; first”)) + ἥλιος (hḗlios, “sun”) (ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *sóh₂wl̥ (“sun”) or a pre-Hellenic language), which was modelled after perigeum (“point in an orbit about the Earth that is closest to the Earth, perigee”)."
