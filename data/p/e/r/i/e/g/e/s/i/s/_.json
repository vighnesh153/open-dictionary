        "Borrowed from Koine Greek περιήγησις (periḗgēsis, “the action of being shown around, as by a guide (chiefly in the titles of works)”), from Ancient Greek περι- (peri-, “peri-, prefix meaning ‘around, surrounding’”) + ἥγησις (hḗgēsis, “command, leading”) (from ἡγέομαι (hēgéomai, “to lead”) + -σῐς (-sis, “suffix forming nouns”)), from περιηγεῖσθαι (periēgeîsthai, “to lead around”); compare Late Latin periegesis. Cognate with Greek περιήγηση (periígisi, “tour, sightseeing”)."
