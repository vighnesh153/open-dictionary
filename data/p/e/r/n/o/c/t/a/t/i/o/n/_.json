        "Learned borrowing from Late Latin pernoctātiō (“act of spending of the night (doing something, particularly praying)”) + English -ion (suffix forming nouns indicating an action or process, or the result of an action or process). Pernoctātiō is derived from Latin pernoctātus (“having spent the night”) + -iō (suffix forming abstract nouns from verbs); pernoctātus is the perfect passive participle of pernoctō (“to spend the night”), from per- (prefix with the sense of completion or entirety forming verbs) + nox (“night; darkness”) (ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *nókʷts (“night; evening (?)”), possibly from *negʷ- (“bare, naked”) in the sense of becoming bare of sunlight)."
