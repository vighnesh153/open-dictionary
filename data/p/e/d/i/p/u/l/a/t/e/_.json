                    "A man lay down on his back on a mattress spread on the ground, put his legs up in the air, and on the soles of his feet was placed a massive empty bronze waterjar four feet deep, into the mouth of which climbed a small boy. The man spun it with his feet, tossed it up in the air, caught it on the soles of his feet again, sometimes causing the jar to stand with its mouth uppermost while he spun it round and round, then tossed it up again, and caught it on its side, the boy the whole time sitting unconcernedly inside. . . . It took two men to lift the empty jar on to his feet to begin with, and the most extraordinary thing is the great weight he thus pedipulates."
