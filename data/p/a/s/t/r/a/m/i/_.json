        "Borrowed from Yiddish פּאַסטראַמע‎ (pastrame), from Romanian pastramă, from Ottoman Turkish باصدرمه‎ (modern Turkish pastırma), a variation of bastırma (“dried meat”), from root bas- (“to press”). It is sometimes claimed that the origin of the Turkish word is Greek παστώνω (pastóno, “I salt”), from Ancient Greek παστός (pastós, “sprinkled with salt, salted”). The English spelling ending in -mi is probably from the influence of salami."
