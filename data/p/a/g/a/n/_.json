      "description": [
        "From Middle English pagan (adjective and noun), from Latin pāgānus (“rural, rustic\", later \"civilian”), replaced Middle English payen from the same root. The meaning \"not (Judeo-)Christian\" arose in Vulgar Latin, probably from the 4th century. It is unclear whether this usage is derived primarily from the \"rustic\" or from the \"civilian\" meaning, which in Roman army jargon meant 'clumsy'. As a self-designation of neopagans attested since 1990.",
        "Partly displaced native heathen, from Old English hǣþen."
