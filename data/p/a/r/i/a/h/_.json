      "description": [
        "From Tamil பறையர் (paṟaiyar), from பறையன் (paṟaiyaṉ, “drummer”), from பறை (paṟai, “drum”) or from Malayalam പറയർ (paṟayaṟ), from പറയൻ (paṟayaṉ, “drummer”), from പറ (paṟa, “drum”). Parai in Tamil or Para in Malayalam refers to a type of large drum designed to announce the king’s notices to the public. The people who made a living using the parai were called paraiyar; in the caste-based society they were in the lower strata, hence the derisive paraiah and pariah.",
        "Alternatively, derived from Sanskrit पर (para, “distant; outsider”), ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *per-. See for example: Hindi परजन (parjan, “outsider to society”) or Hindi पराया (parāyā, “stranger”)."
