        "From pan- +‎ Ancient Greek θεός (theós, “god, divine”)  +‎ -ism. The term \"pantheist\" - of which \"pantheism\" is a variation - was purportedly first used by Irish writer John Toland in his 1705 work, Socinianism Truly Stated, by a pantheist. A critic of Toland, J. Fay, was the first to use the term \"pantheism\" in 1709, in Defensio Religionis."
