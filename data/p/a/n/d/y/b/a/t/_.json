        "Seems to have been used in Ireland for much of the 20th century. Since James Joyce cites it in the context of a Catholic school in his novel, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, it may have been a pun on the Latin word pendebat, but was more probably derived from the Latin words pande manum, meaning \"hold out your hand\"."
