        "Inherited from Middle English phisonomie, from Anglo-Norman phisenomie, Middle French phisonomie et al., ultimately from Late Latin physiognomia, from Ancient Greek φυσιογνωμονία (phusiognōmonía, “the science or art of judging a man by his features”), from φύσις (phúsis, “physique, appearance”) + γνώμων (gnṓmōn, “one that knows or examines, an interpreter, discerner”).",
        "Middle English phisonomie would regularly develop into *physnomy /ˈfɪznəmi/ (forms of this type are common in Early Modern English, such as fisnomie in All's Well that Ends Well); the modern spelling and pronunciation are due to learned influence."
