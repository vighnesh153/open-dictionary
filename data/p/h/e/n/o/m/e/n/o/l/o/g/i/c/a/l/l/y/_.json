Because of this and the modern access, via the techniques of molecular biology, to molecular processes in the human brain and other bodily systems, there is growing call in the psychiatric community to reformulate the mental health nosology, basing it rather upon the pathophysiological processes which may, or may not, underlie problematic behavioral phenomena."
