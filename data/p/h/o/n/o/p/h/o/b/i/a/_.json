                    "The 50-year-old Gest claims he's in constant pain from beatings during the 15-month marriage. The show business producer claims to be taking 11 different medications a day, some more than once, for headaches, nausea, hypertension, scalp tenderness, insomnia — and phonophobia. Phonophobia? Minnelli might assume that must be Gest's fear of being phony. After all, she denies all the allegations of violence. However, phonophobia is the fear of using a telephone and, especially, the fear of the sound of your own voice."
