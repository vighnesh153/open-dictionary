        "Coined by philologist and psychical researcher Frederic W. H. Myers (1843-1901) on the model of English amnesia via New Latin amnēsia, a learned borrowing from Koine Greek ἀμνησία (amnēsía). The essential components προ- (pro-, “pre-, before”) +‎ μνήμη (mnḗmē, “memory”) +‎ -ία (-ía), formed by analogy to Greek αμνησία (amnisía), substituting prefix pro- for the privative a- attached to a root from Ancient Greek μιμνήσκω (mimnḗskō, “to remind, recall”), μνάομαι (mnáomai, “to remember”) from Proto-Indo-European *men- (“to think, mind”). Compare Greek προμνησία (promnisía)."
