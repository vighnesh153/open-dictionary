        "Borrowed from German Prozymit, from Medieval Latin prozymīta, from Byzantine Greek προζυμίτης (prozumítēs), from Ancient Greek προζύμιον (prozúmion, “leaven”) + -ῑ́της (-ī́tēs, suffix forming masculine nouns meaning being connected to or a member of something, or coming from a particular place). προζύμιον is derived from προ- (pro-, suffix meaning ‘before, in front’) + ζύμη (zúmē, “leaven, yeast”) + -ιον (-ion, suffix forming nouns). The English word is analysable as pro- +‎ zymo- +‎ -ite."
