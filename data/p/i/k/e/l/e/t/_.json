        "Derived from Welsh bara pyglyd (“pitchy [i.e. dark or sticky] bread”), later shortened simply to pyglyd. The early 17th century lexicographer, Randle Cotgrave, spoke of \"our Welsh barrapycleds\". The word spread to the West Midlands of England, where it was anglicised to picklets and then to pikelets."
